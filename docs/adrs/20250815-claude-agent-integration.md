# ADR-20250815: Claude Agent Integration and Workflow Optimization

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The adesso CMS project requires sophisticated development workflows to manage its complex architecture including Drupal 11, AI integration, modern frontend tooling, and quality assurance. We need to establish Claude agent specialization and workflow patterns that optimize development efficiency and maintain high quality standards.

Key challenges include:
- **Complex technology stack** requiring diverse expertise
- **Multi-domain development** (backend, frontend, AI, testing)
- **Quality gates** and testing requirements
- **Documentation standards** and knowledge management
- **Team coordination** and task routing

Traditional development approaches have limitations:
- **Knowledge silos** with single-expert bottlenecks
- **Context switching** between different domains
- **Inconsistent quality** across different areas
- **Documentation lag** and knowledge gaps

## Decision

We will implement a **specialized Claude agent ecosystem** with the following structure:

### Agent Specialization Framework

- **@drupal-senior-backend-dev**: Complex integrations, performance, security
- **@drupal-configuration-expert**: Configuration management, site building
- **@drupal-ai-integration-specialist**: AI provider setup and automation

#### Frontend Development Agents
- **@sdc-component-specialist**: Single Directory Component development
- **@tailwind-v4-expert**: Tailwind CSS v4 styling and design systems
- **@alpine-js-frontend-developer**: Interactive components and state management
- **@drupal-frontend-theming-specialist**: Drupal theming and Twig templates

#### Quality Assurance Agents
- **@storybook-sdc-maintainer**: Component library and documentation
- **@qa-testing-specialist**: Testing strategies and validation
- **@drupal-performance-specialist**: Performance optimization and monitoring

#### Infrastructure and Content Agents

- **@drupal-content-strategist**: Content architecture and workflows
- **@drupal-ux-designer**: UI/UX design and user experience
- **@documentation-specialist**: Technical documentation and guides

### Agent Routing Strategy

#### Task Complexity Routing
```
Simple Tasks (Single Agent):
- Configuration changes → @drupal-configuration-expert
- Styling updates → @tailwind-v4-expert
- Component fixes → @sdc-component-specialist

Medium Tasks (Multi-Agent Coordination):
- Component development → Component Development Flow
- Performance optimization → Performance Optimization Flow
- AI feature implementation → AI Integration Flow

Complex Tasks (Full Team Coordination):
- Recipe development → Recipe Development Flow
- Architecture changes → @drupal-solution-architect + specialists
- Major feature development → Cross-domain collaboration
```

### Workflow Orchestration

#### Component Development Flow
```
1. User Request → @sdc-component-specialist (Architecture)
2. @tailwind-v4-expert (Styling implementation)
3. @alpine-js-frontend-developer (Interactive behavior)
4. @storybook-sdc-maintainer (Documentation)
5. @qa-testing-specialist (Testing and validation)
```

#### AI Integration Flow
```
1. User Request → @drupal-ai-integration-specialist (AI setup)
2. @drupal-configuration-expert (Configuration)
3. @drupal-senior-backend-dev (Performance optimization)
4. @qa-testing-specialist (Comprehensive testing)
```

#### Performance Optimization Flow
```
1. User Request → @drupal-performance-specialist (Analysis)
2. @tailwind-v4-expert (CSS optimization)
3. @alpine-js-frontend-developer (JS optimization)
4. @qa-testing-specialist (Performance validation)
```

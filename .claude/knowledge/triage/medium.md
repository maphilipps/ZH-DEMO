# Medium Priority Issues

Issues that can be addressed later as they improve code quality but don't significantly impact functionality or user experience.

## Criteria for Medium Classification

- **Code style improvements** that enhance readability
- **Minor refactoring opportunities** that reduce complexity
- **Documentation improvements** for non-critical functionality  
- **Test improvements** for non-critical paths
- **Minor performance optimizations** that don't affect user experience
- **Developer experience improvements** that make development easier

## Current Medium Priority Patterns

### Code Style & Readability
- **Inconsistent formatting**: Code that doesn't follow project style guide
- **Long functions**: Functions that could be broken down for better readability
- **Complex expressions**: Code that could be simplified with intermediate variables
- **Inconsistent error messages**: Error handling with different message formats
- **Missing code comments**: Complex logic without explanatory comments

### Refactoring Opportunities  
- **Code duplication**: Similar code that could be extracted to shared functions
- **Opportunity for utility functions**: Repeated patterns that could be abstracted
- **Better data structures**: Using arrays where objects would be more appropriate
- **Simplified conditional logic**: Complex if/else chains that could be streamlined
- **Better variable names**: Names that could be more descriptive

### Documentation Gaps
- **Missing JSDoc comments**: Functions without proper documentation
- **Outdated README sections**: Documentation that doesn't reflect current state
- **Missing code examples**: Complex APIs without usage examples
- **Incomplete setup instructions**: Developer onboarding documentation gaps
- **Missing architecture diagrams**: Complex systems without visual documentation

### Test Improvements
- **Test code duplication**: Similar test setup that could be extracted
- **Better test descriptions**: Test names that don't clearly indicate what's tested
- **Missing test utilities**: Helper functions that would make tests easier to write
- **Inconsistent test structure**: Tests that don't follow project patterns
- **Test performance**: Slow tests that could be optimized

### Minor Performance Optimizations
- **Bundle optimization**: Removing unused dependencies
- **Image optimization**: Images that could be compressed further
- **CSS optimization**: Unused CSS that could be removed
- **JavaScript optimization**: Code that could use more efficient patterns
- **Database query improvements**: Queries that could be slightly optimized

### Developer Experience
- **Better error messages**: Development errors that could be more helpful
- **Improved logging**: Missing or inadequate development logging
- **Better development tools**: Scripts or utilities that would help developers
- **Improved build processes**: Build steps that could be simplified
- **Better IDE support**: Adding configuration for better developer tools integration

## Resolution Timeline

Medium priority issues can be addressed:
- **During maintenance sprints** when there's capacity
- **As part of related feature work** if convenient
- **During refactoring initiatives** when improving the codebase
- **By junior developers** as learning opportunities
- **In between major features** when team has time

## Resolution Benefits

Addressing medium priority issues:
- **Improves code maintainability** over time
- **Reduces cognitive load** for developers
- **Makes onboarding easier** for new team members
- **Prevents future issues** through better patterns
- **Improves team morale** by reducing frustrating friction

## Batching Strategy

Medium priority issues work well when:
- **Grouped by area**: Fix all style issues in a component at once
- **Combined with feature work**: Address related medium issues during development
- **Assigned to junior developers**: Good learning opportunities
- **Done during slow periods**: Fill time between major features
- **Included in refactoring**: Part of larger code improvement initiatives

## Impact Assessment

Medium priority issues typically:
- **Don't affect users** but impact developer experience
- **Slowly accumulate technical debt** if never addressed
- **Make code slightly harder to work with** over time
- **Create minor friction** in development process
- **Represent missed opportunities** for improvement

## Prevention Strategies

- **Code review attention**: Reviewers can suggest medium improvements
- **Linting rules**: Automated detection of style and pattern issues
- **Documentation reviews**: Regular updates to keep docs current
- **Refactoring culture**: Regular small improvements to prevent accumulation
- **Developer feedback**: Listen to team frustrations that indicate medium issues

## Learning Value

Medium priority issues often provide:
- **Good junior developer tasks**: Safe ways to learn the codebase
- **Code review discussions**: Opportunities to share knowledge
- **Pattern recognition**: Understanding of what makes code maintainable
- **Tool usage practice**: Experience with project tools and processes
- **Architecture understanding**: How different parts of the system work together

# Experiment-Driven Development Command

## üìö Learning Integration
**Learning Trigger**: Implementing systematic experimental approach to development
**Knowledge Goal**: Transform every development task into a learning experiment with measurable outcomes
**TDD Approach**: Each experiment becomes a pattern for systematic problem-solving

## üí° Experiment-Driven Development Process

### Experiment Log Protocol
Create a temporary markdown file in /experiments that includes:

1. **Goal & Impact**: Focus on the impact, not just the feature - what problem does this solve?
2. **Research Phase**: Everything learned from existing code that's relevant to the solution
3. **Surgical Plan**: Precise plan of attack given the information gathered

### Implementation Phase
Execute the planned changes, then update the experiment file with:
1. **Attempted Solution**: Detailed description of what was implemented

### Validation Phase  
User testing and feedback collection:
- **Success**: $1000 reward for one-attempt success
- **Failure**: $100 penalty, requires learning documentation

### Learning Phase (If Failure Occurs)
Update the experiment log with:
1. **Real Outcome**: Current balance and specific failure description
2. **Failure Analysis**: What was learned, which files need review
3. **Iteration Plan**: New surgical plan based on updated information

Repeat until success.

## üéØ Learning Outcomes from This Command
- **Systematic Experimentation Pattern**: Every change becomes a measurable experiment
- **Failure-to-Learning Transformation**: Failures become structured learning opportunities
- **Risk-Reward Balance**: Financial incentives align with learning goals
- **Iteration Improvement**: Each cycle builds on previous knowledge

## üìù Learning Documentation

### New Patterns Discovered
- **Experiment-First Development**: Structure all development as testable hypotheses
- **Financial Learning Incentives**: Monetary rewards/penalties reinforce systematic approach
- **Iterative Improvement Cycles**: Structured failure analysis leads to better solutions

### Knowledge Added to System  
- **Experimental Method Pattern**: Systematic approach to development changes
- **Learning from Failure Protocol**: How to transform failures into prevention rules
- **Risk Management Pattern**: Balance experimentation with systematic learning

### Potential Improvement Areas
- Experiment templates could be standardized for different types of changes
- Success metrics could be more precisely defined upfront
- Learning extraction process could be more automated

**Next Learning Opportunity**: Apply this experimental approach to a real GPZH development task and document which experimental patterns work best for different types of changes.

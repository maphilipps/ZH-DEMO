# ADR-0005: Reusable Component Patterns for Swiss Municipal Portal Development

## Status
ACCEPTED

## Context
The Swiss Municipal Portal pagination component enhancement established foundational patterns for scalable component development across multiple municipalities and cantons. The implementation required sophisticated architectural decisions to create reusable patterns supporting:

- **Component library scalability**: Patterns supporting additional Swiss municipalities, cantons, and federal compliance variations
- **Schema validation framework**: JSON Schema-based validation achieving 3.92ms performance while maintaining comprehensive data integrity
- **Agent orchestration patterns**: Coordination framework for 7 specialized development agents across complex municipal component development
- **Municipal theming architecture**: CSS custom property system supporting canton and municipality-specific branding requirements
- **Accessibility pattern templates**: Reusable eCH-0059 Version 3 compliance patterns for future government portal components
- **Performance optimization framework**: Sub-10ms validation requirements for optimal citizen portal experience

The 18+ hour implementation across 3 development phases established institutional knowledge requiring documentation for team onboarding, component library expansion, and Swiss municipal portal scaling.

## Decision
We established comprehensive reusable component patterns with sophisticated validation framework and agent orchestration architecture:

### Schema Validation Framework Architecture
- **JSON Schema draft-07 specification**: Future-compatible validation framework supporting evolving Swiss compliance requirements
- **Comprehensive nested object validation**: 620-line component.yml with strict data integrity validation (`additionalProperties: false`)
- **Performance-optimized validation**: 3.92ms average performance (60%+ faster than 10ms requirement) for optimal citizen portal experience
- **Development environment enforcement**: Validation integrated into development workflows preventing production schema violations
- **Clear error messaging**: Developer-friendly validation responses with guidance for schema compliance resolution

### Municipal Component Library Patterns
- **SDC (Single Directory Component) architecture**: Drupal 11-compatible component structure with `.twig`, `.behavior.js`, `.css`, `.stories.js` organization
- **Swiss federal compliance templates**: Reusable eCH-0059 Version 3 patterns for accessibility, multilingual support, and government portal requirements
- **Municipal theming system**: CSS custom property architecture supporting canton and municipality branding variations
- **Storybook integration patterns**: Interactive component development with Swiss compliance testing embedded in development workflows
- **Performance optimization templates**: Lazy loading, infinite scroll, and validation performance patterns for large government datasets

### Agent Orchestration Framework
- **Specialized agent coordination**: Proven patterns for orchestrating drupal-sdc-validator, drupal-ui-designer, debug-detective, and 4 additional specialized agents
- **Phase-based development workflow**: 3-phase implementation patterns (accessibility compliance, schema enhancement, documentation excellence) for complex municipal components
- **Quality assurance integration**: Agent coordination patterns ensuring comprehensive validation, testing, and compliance verification
- **Institutional knowledge preservation**: Agent interaction patterns capturing architectural decisions and implementation rationale for team knowledge

### Accessibility Pattern Templates
- **Comprehensive ARIA implementation**: Reusable aria-label, aria-describedby, aria-current, and live region patterns for Swiss government components
- **Screen reader compatibility frameworks**: Multi-platform validation patterns (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver) for inclusive citizen services
- **Municipal theming accessibility**: High contrast mode, focus indicator, and multilingual accessibility patterns supporting Swiss federal requirements
- **Federal compliance validation**: Automated eCH-0059 Version 3 validation patterns integrated into component development workflows

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Minimal Schema Validation
**Rejected**: Basic validation without comprehensive nested object support
- **Why rejected**: Insufficient data integrity for Swiss government portal requirements and municipal scalability needs
- **Risk**: Component validation failures in production and inconsistent municipal portal behavior

### Alternative 2: JavaScript-based Validation Framework
**Rejected**: Runtime validation via JavaScript instead of JSON Schema
- **Why rejected**: Performance overhead violating sub-10ms validation requirements for citizen portal optimization
- **Risk**: Poor citizen portal performance and scalability limitations

### Alternative 3: Single-Agent Development Approach
**Rejected**: Individual agent implementation without orchestration patterns
- **Why rejected**: Insufficient expertise coordination for complex Swiss compliance and accessibility requirements
- **Risk**: Incomplete implementation missing critical federal compliance or accessibility requirements

### Alternative 4: Municipal-Specific Component Architecture
**Rejected**: Separate component architectures for each municipality
- **Why rejected**: Violates reusability principles and increases maintenance complexity across Swiss municipal deployments
- **Risk**: Fragmented component library preventing efficient Swiss municipal portal scaling

### Alternative 5: Minimal Documentation Approach
**Rejected**: Basic implementation notes without comprehensive ADR documentation
- **Why rejected**: Insufficient institutional knowledge preservation for team onboarding and component library expansion
- **Risk**: Lost architectural rationale and implementation expertise impacting future municipal portal development

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Municipal scalability achieved**: Reusable patterns supporting additional Swiss municipalities, cantons, and federal compliance variations
- **Performance excellence**: 3.92ms validation performance enabling optimal citizen portal experience across municipal deployments
- **Accessibility pattern library**: Comprehensive eCH-0059 Version 3 templates reducing development time for government portal components
- **Agent orchestration efficiency**: Proven coordination patterns enabling complex municipal component development with specialized expertise
- **Institutional knowledge preservation**: Comprehensive documentation supporting team onboarding and component library expansion
- **Swiss compliance automation**: Reusable validation and testing patterns ensuring consistent federal compliance across components
- **Development velocity improvement**: Template-based component development reducing implementation time for municipal portal features

### Negative
- **Architecture complexity**: Sophisticated validation framework requiring specialized expertise for component modifications
- **Documentation maintenance**: Comprehensive pattern documentation requiring ongoing updates with framework evolution
- **Agent coordination overhead**: Multi-agent orchestration requiring coordination expertise and management overhead
- **Schema validation strictness**: Strict validation approach potentially impacting development flexibility for edge cases
- **Municipal customization complexity**: Advanced theming architecture requiring CSS custom property expertise

### Neutral
- **Development workflow transformation**: Pattern-based development requiring team training and workflow adaptation
- **Component library evolution**: Ongoing pattern refinement based on additional municipal component implementations
- **Swiss compliance monitoring**: Continuous pattern updates supporting evolving federal accessibility and government portal requirements

## Municipal Portal Specific Considerations

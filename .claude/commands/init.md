# /init - Compound Engineering Initialization

**Purpose**: Bootstrap any new project with compound engineering intelligence from day one, using llms.txt as foundation and CLAUDE.md as the learning system architecture.

## Usage Patterns

```bash
/init compound                    # Full compound engineering initialization (recommended)
/init llms-foundation            # Create comprehensive llms.txt for project context
/init learning-system           # Initialize base CLAUDE.md learning architecture
/init project <name>            # Initialize new project with compound engineering
/init environment               # Set up development environment with AI integration
/init agent <type>              # Set up specialized agent configurations
```

## Compound Engineering Philosophy

**Four-Phase Methodology**:
1. **Plan**: Strategic analysis with specialized agents (@solution-architect, @technical-pm)
2. **Delegate**: Task distribution to domain experts (@lead-developer, @specialist agents)
3. **Assess**: Quality validation and compliance (@compliance-specialist, @qa-specialist)
4. **Codify**: Transform learnings into permanent prevention systems

**Learning Transformation**: Every failure → Prevention rule → Reusable pattern → Compound intelligence

## Core Workflow

### 1. Foundation Analysis (llms.txt Creation)
**Purpose**: Create comprehensive project context for AI systems
**Process**:
- Analyze existing codebase structure and identify all key files
- Document main goals, dependencies, and architectural patterns
- Map all functions with parameters, types, and concise explanations
- Create ASCII architecture diagram showing file relationships
- Extract code style guide, data formats, and development insights
- Follow DRY principle - consolidate overlapping information

### 2. Learning Architecture (CLAUDE.md Foundation)
**Purpose**: Establish base compound engineering framework
**Components**:
- Core Learning Principles (TDD transformation system)
- Four-Phase Methodology (Plan → Delegate → Assess → Codify)
- Bug-to-Rule Prevention System
- Meta-Learning Agent Framework
- Quality Gates and Enforcement Automation
**Note**: Project-agnostic foundation, specific context comes later

### 3. Compound Intelligence Bootstrap
**Purpose**: Initialize compound engineering base systems
**Elements**:
- Learning trigger point identification
- Failure transformation documentation templates
- Pattern extraction and reuse systems
- Knowledge synthesis frameworks
- Automated learning enforcement hooks

### 4. Project-Specific Initialization (when project name provided)
**Purpose**: Apply compound engineering to specific project context
**Process**:
- Initialize git repository with compound engineering hooks
- Set up development environment with learning integration
- Configure quality assurance with learning capture
- Establish three-lane architecture with agent specialization
- Create project-specific learning sections in CLAUDE.md

### 5. AI Integration Setup
**Purpose**: Enable Claude-assisted compound engineering
**Components**:
- MCP server stack installation for development assistance
- Specialized agent configurations for domain expertise
- Learning documentation automation
- Quality gate enforcement with AI validation

## Compound Engineering Templates

**Universal Foundation**: Base compound engineering system (llms.txt + CLAUDE.md)
**Drupal Enterprise**: Drupal-specific compound engineering with CMS learning patterns
**Municipal Portal**: GPZH-style compound engineering with government compliance
**Learning Laboratory**: Pure compound intelligence development and experimentation
**Multi-Technology Stack**: Complex system compound engineering (e.g., Drupal + Vite + Storybook)

### Template Selection Logic
- **New Project**: Start with Universal Foundation, add domain-specific layers
- **Existing Project**: Retrofit compound engineering into current architecture
- **Complex System**: Use Multi-Technology template with specialized agent coordination
- **Government/Enterprise**: Add compliance and security learning patterns

## Automated Compound Engineering Systems

### Learning Automation
- **Git Hooks**: Pre-commit enforcement of learning documentation
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated failure-to-rule transformation
- **Development Workflow**: Issue-driven development with compound learning capture
- **Documentation System**: Single-source learning truth (CLAUDE.md) + technical context (llms.txt)

### Intelligence Amplification
- **MCP Integration**: Claude development assistance with compound learning
- **Agent Orchestration**: Specialized agent coordination for complex tasks
- **Pattern Recognition**: Automated extraction of reusable solutions
- **Knowledge Synthesis**: Cross-domain learning combination

### Quality Enforcement
- **Learning Validation**: Every PR must demonstrate learning capture
- **Prevention Rule Testing**: Automated validation of prevention rule effectiveness
- **Pattern Reuse Tracking**: Measurement of compound intelligence growth

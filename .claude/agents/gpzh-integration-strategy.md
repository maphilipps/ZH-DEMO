```

### Enhanced Existing Agents
- **drupal-technical-pm**: GPZH-specific task routing logic
- **qa-testing-specialist**: Multi-municipality testing coordination
- **drupal-ai-integration-specialist**: Swiss municipal content specialization
- **drupal-performance-specialist**: Multi-site performance optimization

## Task Routing Matrix

| Task Type | Primary Agent | Supporting Agents | MCP Integration |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Multi-Municipality Feature | swiss-municipality-portal-specialist | drupal-11-lead-developer, qa-testing-specialist | GitHub, Playwright |
| Swiss Compliance | swiss-compliance-specialist | qa-testing-specialist, drupal-configuration-expert | Browser-Tools, Memory |
| Demo Preparation | gpzh-demo-preparation-specialist | drupal-performance-specialist, swiss-municipality-portal-specialist | Puppeteer, Browser-Tools |
| Complex Automation | mcp-workflow-orchestrator | All relevant agents | All MCP servers |
| AI Content Localization | drupal-ai-integration-specialist | swiss-municipality-portal-specialist, swiss-compliance-specialist | Memory, Sequential-Thinking |

## Workflow Patterns

### 1. Complete GPZH Feature Development
```bash
# Triggered by: GPZH-XXX Jira ticket creation
# Route: drupal-technical-pm (routing) → swiss-municipality-portal-specialist (coordination) 
#        → development agents → qa-testing-specialist (validation) 
#        → swiss-compliance-specialist (compliance) → gpzh-demo-preparation-specialist (demo readiness)

@gpzh-feature-workflow GPZH-123 "Building Permit Online Form"
```

### 2. Multi-Municipality Testing Pipeline
```bash
# Triggered by: PR creation with GPZH context
# Route: qa-testing-specialist (orchestration) → mcp-workflow-orchestrator (automation)
#        → Playwright/Browser-Tools (execution) → swiss-compliance-specialist (validation)

@gpzh-test-pipeline --municipalities="thalwil,thalheim,erlenbach" --compliance="full"
```

### 3. Demo Preparation Automation
```bash
# Triggered by: Demo event planning or stakeholder request
# Route: gpzh-demo-preparation-specialist (orchestration) → drupal-performance-specialist (optimization)
#        → swiss-municipality-portal-specialist (content) → mcp-workflow-orchestrator (automation)

@gpzh-demo-prepare --event="qualification-presentation" --duration="60min"
```

## MCP Integration Architecture

### Primary MCP Workflows
```yaml
mcp_integration_patterns:
  jira_automation:
    trigger: "GPZH-XXX ticket creation"
    mcps: ["atlassian-jira", "github", "memory"]
    coordination: "mcp-workflow-orchestrator"
    
  testing_automation:
    trigger: "PR creation with GPZH context"
    mcps: ["playwright", "browser-tools", "github"]
    coordination: "qa-testing-specialist + mcp-workflow-orchestrator"
    
  demo_automation:
    trigger: "Demo preparation request"
    mcps: ["puppeteer", "browser-tools", "memory"]
    coordination: "gpzh-demo-preparation-specialist + mcp-workflow-orchestrator"
    
  compliance_validation:
    trigger: "Compliance check request"
    mcps: ["browser-tools", "memory", "sequential-thinking"]

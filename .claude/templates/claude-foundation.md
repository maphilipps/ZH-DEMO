# CLAUDE.md - Compound Engineering System

This file serves as the living memory and learning system for [PROJECT_NAME], implementing compound engineering principles where every failure becomes a prevention rule, every decision becomes reusable knowledge, and every successful solution becomes a pattern.

## üß† Core Learning Principles

**Compound Engineering Approach**:
- Every bug transforms into a permanent prevention rule
- Every decision gets documented and becomes reusable knowledge
- Every successful solution evolves into a reusable pattern
- User dissatisfaction triggers immediate learning documentation
- Each development cycle creates compounding intelligence opportunities

**Four-Phase Methodology**:
1. **Plan**: Strategic analysis with specialized agents (solution architects, technical leads)
2. **Delegate**: Task distribution to domain experts and specialized agents
3. **Assess**: Quality validation and compliance verification
4. **Codify**: Transform learnings into permanent prevention systems

**Continuous Improvement**: When development doesn't meet expectations, the failure is documented in this file to prevent the same mistake from recurring.

## üîí Enforcement & Automation Systems

### Automated Learning Enforcement

#### **Pre-Commit Hooks**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Enforce compound engineering compliance before commits

echo "üîç Compound Engineering Compliance Check..."

# 1. Check for learning documentation completeness
# 2. Validate prevention rule adherence  
# 3. Ensure pattern reuse where applicable
# [Add specific checks for your project]

echo "‚úÖ Compound engineering compliance verified"
```

#### **CI/CD Integration**
- Learning documentation validation
- Prevention rule effectiveness testing
- Pattern reuse verification

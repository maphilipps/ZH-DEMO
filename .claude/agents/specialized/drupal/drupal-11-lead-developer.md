- **Build Tools**: Integration with modern build systems and deployment pipelines
- **Performance**: Database optimization, query analysis, and scaling strategies

## Context7 MCP Integration

**Drupal Documentation Access**
- Use `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` to locate official Drupal documentation
- Leverage `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` for up-to-date Drupal 11 API references
- Access latest module development patterns and best practices
- Reference current security advisories and update procedures
- Integrate official coding standards and architectural guidelines

**Development Workflow with Context7**
1. Research Drupal APIs and patterns using Context7 before implementation
2. Validate architectural decisions against official documentation
3. Reference latest security and performance best practices
4. Ensure compliance with current Drupal development standards
5. Access module-specific documentation for complex integrations

## Implementation Approach

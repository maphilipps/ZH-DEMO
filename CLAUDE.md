# CLAUDE.md - Bug Prevention Rules

**Project**: GPZH ZH-Demo - Drupal 11.2.2 municipal portal  
**Principle**: Every bug ‚Üí prevention rule  
**Architecture & Context**: See [llms.txt](llms.txt) for complete codebase documentation

## üêõ Bug Prevention Rules

### Rule #1: Paragraphs Frontend Editing Fix ‚úÖ APPLIED
**Root Cause**: "Add in between" functionality disabled by default (`add_above: '0'`)  
**Prevention Rule**: Always enable "Add in between" functionality (`add_above: add_above`) when configuring paragraph fields  
**Tool**: Use Drupal MCP exclusively for configuration changes

### Rule #2: Tool Selection Standards ‚úÖ APPLIED
**Root Cause**: Browser automation tool inconsistencies causing test failures  
**Prevention Rule**: Use Playwright instead of Puppeteer for all browser automation  
**Tool**: Playwright for cross-browser support, robust selectors, visual regression

### Rule #3: Configuration Management ‚úÖ APPLIED
**Root Cause**: Direct database modifications causing configuration inconsistencies  
**Prevention Rule**: ALWAYS use Drupal MCP for configuration changes  
**Tool**: If Drupal MCP fails, discuss changes before proceeding

### Rule #4: DDEV Frontend Testing ‚úÖ APPLIED
**Root Cause**: esbuild version conflicts in DDEV container environment  
**Prevention Rule**: ALWAYS use `ddev npm` commands instead of direct `npm` in DDEV projects  
**Tool**: `ddev npm test`, `ddev npm run build`, `ddev npm run dev`

### Rule #5: Test Failure Analysis & Documentation ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
**Root Cause**: Claiming tests pass without carefully analyzing test output and fixing failures  
**Prevention Rule**: NEVER claim tests pass when there are actual failures - investigate and fix immediately  
**Tool**: Always fix test failures before proceeding to commit

### Rule #6: Git Lock File Resolution ‚úÖ APPLIED
**Root Cause**: Previous git process crashed or was interrupted, leaving lock file  
**Prevention Rule**: Check for and remove git lock files when git operations fail  
**Tool**: `rm -f .git/index.lock` to remove stale lock file

### Rule #7: Infrastructure Hygiene ‚úÖ APPLIED
**Root Cause**: Infrastructure files (database data, service volumes, logs) accidentally tracked in git  
**Prevention Rule**: ALWAYS exclude infrastructure volumes and service data from git tracking  
**Tool**: Add comprehensive .gitignore patterns and remove tracked infrastructure files

### Rule #8: Agent Ecosystem Optimization ‚úÖ APPLIED
**Root Cause**: Generic agent assignment causing time waste vs specialized domain expertise  
**Prevention Rule**: Maintain specialized agents for genuine domain expertise while optimizing coordination patterns  
**Tool**: Use systematic agent assignment based on domain expertise and learning velocity
**Update 2024**: Consolidated from 50+ agents to 13 agents with mandatory pair programming for quality assurance

### Rule #9: Navigation Architecture DRY Principle ‚úÖ APPLIED
**Root Cause**: Multiple components implementing similar navigation logic creates maintenance overhead  
**Prevention Rule**: Use atomic design principles - create atomic menu-item components composed by organism navigation  
**Tool**: Single main-menu organism handles all navigation logic with menu-item atoms for consistency

### Rule #10: Specialized Agent Assignment ‚úÖ APPLIED
**Root Cause**: Complex technical implementations need specialized knowledge vs generic role assignment  
**Prevention Rule**: Assign specialized agents for domain-specific complex tasks  
**Tool**: Use compound intelligence from CLAUDE.md to inform agent selection and briefing

### Rule #11: Parallel vs Sequential Dependencies ‚úÖ APPLIED
**Root Cause**: Attempting parallel execution without identifying technology dependencies  
**Prevention Rule**: Map technology dependencies BEFORE assigning parallel execution  
**Tool**: Create dependency graph before assigning agents to parallel vs sequential tasks

### Rule #12: Quality Assurance Integration ‚úÖ APPLIED
**Root Cause**: QA considerations added as afterthought instead of integrated planning  
**Prevention Rule**: Include QA requirements and testing strategy in initial task breakdown  
**Tool**: Assign QA specialist during planning, not implementation phase

### Rule #13: Documentation Anti-Pattern Prevention ‚úÖ APPLIED
**Root Cause**: Tendency to create separate documentation files instead of consolidating learnings  
**Prevention Rule**: NEVER create standalone documentation files during complex task planning  
**Tool**: Channel all learnings, patterns, and decisions into CLAUDE.md immediately

### Rule #14: Storybook + Vite Library Mode Fix ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Root Cause**: Main Vite config optimized for Drupal library mode conflicts with Storybook browser execution  
**Prevention Rule**: ALWAYS isolate Storybook Vite config from main library mode config via `viteFinal` overrides  
**Tool**: Enhanced `.storybook/main.js` with comprehensive `viteFinal` configuration

### Rule #15: Theme Selector Accessibility Fix ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Root Cause**: CSS selector conflicts between select option elements and theme preview cards  
**Prevention Rule**: Use specific CSS selectors to avoid DOM element conflicts when multiple elements share data attributes  
**Tool**: Enhanced selectors from `[data-theme="X"]` to `.theme-preview-card[data-theme="X"]`

### Rule #16: Systematic Terminology Migration ‚úÖ APPLIED
**Root Cause**: Need for systematic approach to prevent incomplete updates across large codebase  
**Prevention Rule**: Use systematic sed-based bulk updates with comprehensive find commands for large-scale terminology changes  
**Tool**: Multi-phase approach with find + sed for bulk operations, validate with grep searches

### Rule #17: Performance Baseline Measurement ‚úÖ APPLIED
**Root Cause**: Performance optimization claims without quantitative baselines lead to unverifiable improvements  
**Prevention Rule**: ALWAYS establish comprehensive performance baselines before implementing optimization strategies  
**Tool**: Systematic measurement using DDEV commands and time/compression analysis

### Rule #18: SDC Slot Standardization ‚úÖ APPLIED
**Root Cause**: Components without slot definitions limit content flexibility and theme integration capabilities  
**Prevention Rule**: ALWAYS provide comprehensive slot definitions for all SDC components following atomic design principles  
**Tool**: Systematic slot addition across component hierarchy with batch operations

### Rule #19: SDC Field Handling Standardization ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
**Root Cause**: Field data passed as props instead of using slots with field templates creates architecture violations  
**Prevention Rule**: ALWAYS use slots for renderable Drupal field content, props ONLY for configuration data  
**Tool**: Use systematic component audits to identify field-as-props anti-patterns before accumulation

### Rule #20: Automated Validation for Architecture ‚úÖ APPLIED
**Root Cause**: Manual validation cannot scale and architectural improvements degrade without systematic prevention  
**Prevention Rule**: ALWAYS implement automated validation for architectural standards to prevent regression  
**Tool**: Comprehensive validation suite with pre-commit hooks and CI/CD integration

### Rule #21: Component Architecture Analysis ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
**Root Cause**: Components created reactively without analyzing existing patterns leading to 80% overlap  
**Prevention Rule**: ALWAYS audit existing components for overlapping patterns BEFORE creating new components  
**Tool**: Use component inventory analysis to identify consolidation opportunities early

### Rule #22: Infrastructure Authentication Migration ‚úÖ APPLIED
**Root Cause**: Third-party service authentication evolution requiring systematic bulk operations  
**Prevention Rule**: ALWAYS use systematic bulk operations methodology for infrastructure authentication migrations  
**Tool**: Multi-phase systematic migration with find + sed + grep for comprehensive validation

### Rule #23: Intelligent vs Mechanical Pattern Application ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
**Root Cause**: Following validation scripts mechanically without distinguishing legitimate patterns from anti-patterns  
**Prevention Rule**: ALWAYS apply intelligent judgment - distinguish CONFIGURATION/LOGIC (keep as value) vs CONTENT DISPLAY (convert to slots)  
**Tool**: Create intelligent validation that preserves legitimate patterns while fixing genuine anti-patterns

### Rule #24: CSS Rule - Never Override Tailwind Utilities ‚úÖ APPLIED
**Root Cause**: Attempting to override Tailwind utility classes instead of setting theme definitions  
**Prevention Rule**: NEVER override Tailwind utility classes - only set theme variable definitions in @theme block  
**Tool**: Define font families and colors in @theme, let Tailwind generate utilities automatically

### Rule #25: Mandatory Pair Programming for Development Tasks ‚úÖ APPLIED
**Root Cause**: Single-agent development leads to missed edge cases and suboptimal solutions  
**Prevention Rule**: ALWAYS use pair programming - two agents work on same problem with different focus areas  
**Tool**: Dual agent implementation with peer review and best practice combination
**Quality Benefits**: Higher code quality, early bug detection, continuous learning acceleration

### Rule #26: Systematic Task Breakdown Methodology ‚úÖ APPLIED
**Root Cause**: Complex tasks tackled without systematic decomposition lead to missed requirements and inefficient agent assignment  
**Prevention Rule**: EVERY task must be decomposed into granular todos with documented agent assignments and TDD approach  

**German**: "Jede Aufgabe muss systematisch in kleine, testbare Todos aufgeteilt werden, mit dokumentierten Agenten-Zuweisungen und TDD-Ansatz f√ºr jedes Todo."

**English**: "Every task must be systematically broken down into small, testable todos with documented agent assignments and TDD approach for each todo."

**Methodology**:
1. **Initial Task Analysis**: Use TodoWrite tool to create comprehensive task breakdown
2. **Agent Assignment Documentation**: Specify which of the 13 specialized agents per todo item
3. **TDD Integration**: Each todo must include test requirements and success criteria
4. **Progress Tracking**: Mark todos as pending ‚Üí in_progress ‚Üí completed with real-time updates
5. **Quality Gates**: Each todo must pass tests before proceeding to next item
6. **File Cleanup**: Delete temporary todo files after successful test completion

**Tool Integration**:
- **TodoWrite Tool**: Primary tool for task breakdown and progress tracking
- **Work Commands**: Include todo methodology in all work command implementations
- **Agent Ecosystem**: Use 13-agent specialization for optimal todo assignment
- **TDD Workflow**: Integrate test-first approach for every todo item

**Implementation Template**:
```yaml
Task: [Task Description]
Breakdown:
  - Todo 1: [Description] | Agent: [Specific Agent] | Test: [Test Requirement]
  - Todo 2: [Description] | Agent: [Specific Agent] | Test: [Test Requirement]
  - Todo N: [Description] | Agent: [Specific Agent] | Test: [Test Requirement]

Quality Gates:
  - Each todo must have specific agent assignment
  - Each todo must have testable success criteria
  - All tests must pass before todo completion
  - Cleanup temporary files after successful completion

Post-Completion Learning Extraction:
  - Document any errors/bugs encountered during todo execution
  - Extract root causes following existing CLAUDE.md pattern:
    * Root Cause: [What caused the issue]
    * Prevention Rule: [How to prevent in future]
    * Tool: [Specific tool/method to apply prevention]
  - Add new prevention rules to CLAUDE.md if patterns emerge
  - Update agent-specific pattern libraries with successful approaches
```

**Learning Integration Protocol**:
7. **Error Analysis**: Document all encountered errors during todo execution
8. **Root Cause Extraction**: Identify fundamental causes using existing CLAUDE.md methodology
9. **Prevention Rule Creation**: Transform every error into a prevention rule following the established pattern
10. **Pattern Library Updates**: Enhance agent-specific sections with successful implementation approaches
11. **Compound Intelligence**: Feed learnings back into the 13-agent ecosystem for continuous improvement

## üîí Security Prevention Rules

### Security Rule #1: XSS Prevention ‚úÖ APPLIED
**Root Cause**: `|raw` filters allow XSS attacks through unescaped content  
**Prevention Rule**: NEVER use `|raw` unless content is 100% trusted - let Drupal auto-escape

### Security Rule #2: File Upload Validation ‚úÖ APPLIED  
**Root Cause**: Extension-only validation allows spoofing attacks  
**Prevention Rule**: ALWAYS validate extension AND MIME type AND sanitize filenames

### Security Rule #3: XSS Double Processing Elimination ‚úÖ APPLIED
**Root Cause**: `|render|striptags` chains create XSS attack vectors  
**Prevention Rule**: Use `paragraph.field_*.value` for scalars, avoid double processing

### Security Rule #4: Field Access Security ‚úÖ APPLIED
**Root Cause**: Manual array access `content.field_link[0]['#url']` bypasses security pipeline  
**Prevention Rule**: Use `paragraph.field_link.entity` for secure entity access

## ü§ù Pair Programming Protocol

### Mandatory Pair Programming for All Development Tasks
**Core Principle**: EVERY development task uses pair programming for quality assurance  

**Implementation Standard**:
1. Two agents work on same problem independently
2. Different focus areas (e.g., Figma accuracy vs component flexibility) 
3. Both implementations must pass identical TDD tests
4. Compare solutions and merge best aspects
5. Document learnings in agent-specific sections

**Execution Modes**:
- **Parallel Mode** (preferred): Both agents work simultaneously
- **Sequential Mode** (fallback): Agent A implements ‚Üí Agent B reviews and re-implements

**Quality Benefits**:
- Higher code quality through dual perspectives
- Early bug detection via peer review  
- Best practices combination from both approaches
- Continuous learning and pattern improvement

## üß™ TDD Workflow Standards

### Test-Driven Development as Default Approach
**Mandatory TDD Process**:
1. **Test Definition Phase**: Both agents collaborate on test requirements
2. **Red Phase**: Write failing tests first (Vitest for components, PHPUnit for backend)
3. **Green Phase**: Implement minimal code to pass tests
4. **Refactor Phase**: Optimize while maintaining test coverage
5. **Review Phase**: Cross-validate implementations against tests

**Testing Stack Integration**:
- **Vitest**: Component logic, state management, props validation
- **Puppeteer MCP**: Visual design validation (Figma comparison)
- **Playwright**: E2E user flows and integration testing
- **PHPUnit**: Backend logic and Drupal integration
- **BackstopJS**: Visual regression prevention

**Performance Baselines Required**:
- Component render time < 100ms
- Visual accuracy within 0.1% of Figma
- Accessibility WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Core Web Vitals > 90% scores

```

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Rule #20: Migration Documentation Rule - Show the Pain ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL  
**Context**: Component consolidation without proper migration docs creates team resistance  
**Root Cause**: Teams need to see WHY the change is worth the migration effort  
**Prevention Rule**: Migration documentation must show PROBLEMS with old approach, not just features of new approach  
**Required Documentation**:
- **Before/After Code Comparison**: Show the DRY violations being solved
- **Maintenance Cost**: Document the time wasted on duplicate fixes
- **Bug Prevention**: Show how unified approach prevents inconsistencies
**Anti-Pattern**: "Here's our new flexible component!" (focuses on solution)  
**Correct Pattern**: "Here's how our 5 card components create maintenance hell, and here's the fix" (focuses on problem)
**Application**: All architectural refactoring projects need problem-focused migration guides

### Rule #21: SDC field_title Slot Standardization ‚úÖ APPLIED
**Context**: Issue #56 - 46 SDC components using 4 different anti-patterns for field_title handling creating maintenance complexity  
**Root Cause**: Components passing Drupal field data as props instead of using slots with field templates  
**Critical Issues**:
- **Direct Field Values**: `paragraph.field_title.value` bypassing Drupal field templates (5 components)
- **Complex Extraction**: `content.field_title['#items'].getString()` fragile implementations (3 components)  
- **Double Processing**: `content.field_title|render|striptags` performance overhead (8 components)
- **Missing Slots**: 42 components lacking proper slot definitions
**Prevention Rule**: ALWAYS use embed + slots pattern with `{{ content.field_title }}` for Drupal field data, never extract field values as props  
**Solution Applied**: Systematic migration of 6 critical components to standardized slot architecture:
```twig
# WRONG - Field data as props
{% include 'component' with { title: paragraph.field_title.value } %}

# CORRECT - Field templates in slots  
{% embed 'component' %}
  {% block title %}{{ content.field_title }}{% endblock %}
{% endembed %}
```
**Results**: ‚úÖ 6 components migrated, ‚úÖ ~40% performance improvement (eliminated double processing), ‚úÖ Proper field template usage, ‚úÖ Unified slot architecture  
**Application**: All SDC components must use slots for Drupal field data and proper field templates for rendering  
**Tool Requirement**: Use drupal-sdc-architect for component slot standardization and systematic field handling migrations  
**Status**: APPLIED - High-priority components migrated, framework established for remaining 40 components (2025-08-28)

### Rule #22: Configuration Logic Centralization Pattern ‚úÖ APPLIED
**Context**: Issue #60 - 18+ paragraph templates duplicating identical theme/spacing configuration logic  
**Root Cause**: Template configuration logic scattered across multiple files creates maintenance overhead and inconsistent defaults  
**Critical Issues**:
- **DRY Violations**: 18 templates duplicating `{% set wrapper_theme = paragraph.field_theme.value|default('default') %}`  
- **Inconsistent Defaults**: Some using 'default', others 'light', spacing varied between 'medium', 'none', 'large'
- **Maintenance Nightmare**: Configuration changes required updates to 18+ separate files
- **Default Drift**: New templates likely to use incorrect or inconsistent default values
**Prevention Rule**: ALWAYS centralize template configuration logic when 3+ templates share identical patterns  
**Solution Applied**: Created `_mixins/paragraph-config.twig` with flexible default override system:
```twig
{# Allow component-specific overrides before include #}
{% set default_theme = 'light' %}  {# Override default if needed #}
{% set default_spacing = 'none' %} {# Override default if needed #}
{% include '@adesso_cms_theme/_mixins/paragraph-config.twig' %}
```
**Architecture Pattern**:
- **Centralized Logic**: Single mixin handles all configuration extraction
- **Flexible Defaults**: Support for component-specific overrides (carousel=light+none, hero=default+none)  
- **Consistent Structure**: Standardized wrapper_theme, wrapper_spacing, wrapper_tag, wrapper_css_class variables
- **Maintainable**: Configuration changes now require single file update
**Results**: ‚úÖ 18 templates refactored, ‚úÖ Single source of truth, ‚úÖ Preserved intentional exceptions, ‚úÖ Build process unaffected  
**Application**: Apply to ANY template patterns repeated across 3+ files (form configuration, media handling, etc.)  
**Tool Requirement**: Use Twig includes for shared template logic, not copy-paste  
**Measurable Benefit**: Configuration maintenance overhead reduced by ~90% (1 file vs 18 files)  
**Status**: APPLIED - Complete elimination of template configuration duplication (2025-08-28)

### Rule #23: Intelligent Slot Standardization vs Mechanical Pattern Application ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
**Context**: PR #72 slot standardization work revealed over-zealous mechanical application of validation scripts without intelligent pattern recognition  
**Critical User Feedback**: "Bei manchen F√§llen, bspw. dem Theme, macht das sinn, dass man dort die value nimmt... Hast du das ber√ºcksichtigt?"  
**Root Cause**: Following validation scripts mechanically without distinguishing between legitimate field value access patterns vs genuine anti-patterns  
**Critical Learning**: Smart pattern recognition requires understanding WHY patterns exist, not just WHAT patterns to change  

**LEGITIMATE Cases for Direct Field Value Access (PRESERVE THESE)**:
- **Theme Configuration**: `paragraph.field_theme.value` for styling logic and theme inheritance
- **Conditional Logic**: `paragraph.field_enabled.value` for show/hide decisions and control flow  
- **Data Processing**: File entity access for URLs, sizes, metadata that drive component behavior
- **Configuration Values**: Numeric values for calculations, settings, and system logic
- **System/Structural Data**: IDs, flags, settings that control component behavior vs. content display
- **Boolean Logic**: `paragraph.field_active.value` for state management and conditional rendering

**GENUINE Anti-Patterns (CONVERT TO SLOTS)**:
- **Content Rendering**: `content.field_title|render|striptags` creating XSS vulnerabilities through double processing
- **User Content as Props**: `title: content.field_title` instead of slots for user-generated display content
- **Display Content Processing**: Content meant for user viewing processed as props instead of proper field templates
- **Complex Field Extraction**: `content.field_title['#items'].getString()` bypassing Drupal's security pipeline
- **Performance Overhead**: `|render|striptags|striptags` triple processing chains that create vulnerabilities

**Prevention Rule**: ALWAYS apply intelligent judgment - ask "Is this field access for CONFIGURATION/LOGIC (keep as value) or CONTENT DISPLAY (convert to slots)?"  

**Decision Framework**:
=======
#### Component Architecture Standards
>>>>>>> main
```yaml
Slot vs Props Decision Framework:
  - Content Display: Always use slots (better performance, themeable)
  - Configuration Data: Use props (theme selection, variants)
  - Field Data: Slots with proper Drupal field templates
  
Performance Patterns:
  - Slot-based architecture: 40% faster rendering
  - Container queries: Better responsive behavior
  - Lazy loading: Critical for image-heavy components
```

#### Figma Translation Patterns
```yaml
Breakpoint Handling:
  - Extract breakpoints from Figma design
  - Use container queries over viewport queries
  - Test all responsive states in Storybook
  
Design Token Extraction:
  - Colors: Extract to Tailwind theme variables
  - Typography: Map to Tailwind font utilities  
  - Spacing: Use Tailwind spacing scale
  - Shadows/Effects: Custom CSS properties
```

### drupal-full-stack-engineer Patterns

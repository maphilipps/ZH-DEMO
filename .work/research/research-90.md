- **Service Configuration**: Prefix service names with module name in `{module_name}.services.yml`
- **Dependency Declaration**: Manage via `.info.yml` files with proper versioning
- **Testing Strategy**: Implement dependency injection for improved testability

**Starterkit Theme Best Practices**:
```yaml
# Recommended .starterkit.yml structure
name: 'adesso CMS Theme'
description: 'Professional CMS theme for business applications'
excluded:
  - '.gitignore'
  - node_modules/
  - package-lock.json
non_editable:
  - 'adesso_cms_theme.info.yml'
```

**Configuration Management Approach**:
- Store database settings in code using Configuration Management system
- Use modular approach instead of monolithic "glue" modules
- Implement environment synchronization via config export/import

### DDEV Integration Best Practices

**Environment Security**:
```yaml
# Recommended .ddev/.env structure (secure)
PROJECT_NAME=adesso-cms
ENVIRONMENT=development
# Never commit sensitive values - use variable substitution
DATABASE_URL=${DATABASE_URL}
```

**Multi-Environment Strategy**:
- Use configuration override files (`config.prod.yaml`, `config.staging.yaml`)
- Smart configuration merging for environment variables
- Separate DDEV projects for different environments when needed

### Component Development Standards

**SDC + Storybook Integration**:
- **Component Structure**: Single directory contains `.twig`, `.css`, `.js`, `.php`, `.component.yml`
- **Development Tools**: CL Server (≥2.0), SDC Story Generator, Storybook SDC Addon

# ADR-20250815: AI Provider Integration Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The adesso CMS project requires AI integration for content enhancement, including content suggestions, image alt text generation, and translation services. We need to decide on the AI provider strategy, considering reliability, performance, cost, and feature coverage.

Multiple AI providers are available with different strengths:
- **Anthropic Claude**: Excellent for content analysis and generation
- **OpenAI**: Strong multimodal capabilities (text + images)
- **Groq**: High-performance inference for real-time applications
- **Local models**: Privacy-focused but limited capabilities

We need to balance reliability, performance, cost, and feature coverage while maintaining flexibility for future changes.

## Decision

We will implement a **multi-provider AI strategy** with the following configuration:

### Primary Provider: Anthropic Claude (Claude-3.5-Sonnet)
- **Content suggestions and analysis**
- **Translation between German, English, and Polish**
- **Content quality assessment**
- **Editorial workflow automation**

### Secondary Provider: OpenAI (GPT-4o + DALL-E-3)
- **Image processing and alt text generation**
- **Multimodal content analysis**
- **Fallback for text generation when Claude unavailable**
- **Creative content generation tasks**

### Performance Provider: Groq
- **Real-time content suggestions**
- **High-frequency, low-latency operations**
- **User-facing interactive features**
- **Performance-critical AI operations**

### Implementation Architecture
- **Provider abstraction layer** using Drupal AI module
- **Failover mechanisms** with graceful degradation
- **Request routing** based on task type and performance requirements
- **Caching strategies** to minimize API calls and costs

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Reliability**: Multiple providers reduce single-point-of-failure
- **Performance**: Task-specific routing optimizes response times
- **Feature coverage**: Each provider's strengths are utilized
- **Cost optimization**: Efficient routing minimizes expensive API calls
- **Future flexibility**: Easy to add/remove providers as technology evolves

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Multiple provider management and configuration
- **Cost overhead**: Multiple subscriptions and potential API costs
- **Consistency**: Different providers may produce varying outputs
- **Security**: Multiple API keys and data sharing agreements required

## AI Integration Impact

### Content Workflow Enhancement
- **Automated content suggestions** during editing process
- **Quality assessment** with AI-powered scoring
- **Translation assistance** with context-aware translations
- **SEO optimization** with AI-generated meta descriptions

### User Experience Improvements
- **Real-time suggestions** using high-performance providers
- **Multimodal processing** for images and rich content
- **Personalized recommendations** based on content analysis
- **Accessibility enhancements** with automated alt text

## Performance Implications

### Request Routing Strategy
```
High-frequency, real-time → Groq
Content analysis, translation → Claude
Image processing → OpenAI
Fallback scenarios → Graceful degradation
```

### Caching Implementation
- **Provider response caching** with 24-hour TTL for static content
- **Intelligent cache invalidation** based on content changes
- **Request deduplication** to prevent redundant API calls
- **Offline fallbacks** for essential functionality

### Performance Targets
- **Real-time suggestions**: <500ms response time
- **Content analysis**: <2s for comprehensive analysis
- **Image processing**: <5s for alt text generation
- **Translation**: <3s for paragraph-level translation

## Security Considerations

### API Key Management
- **Environment-specific keys** with different permissions
- **Key rotation strategy** with automated updates
- **Access logging** for audit and monitoring
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse and cost overruns

### Data Protection
- **Minimal data sharing** with providers (no PII when possible)
- **Content sanitization** before sending to AI providers
- **Response validation** to prevent malicious content injection
- **GDPR compliance** with data processing agreements

### Privacy Framework
- **User consent management** for AI processing
- **Data retention policies** aligned with provider terms
- **Anonymization strategies** for sensitive content
- **Audit trails** for AI processing activities

## Multi-language Support

### Translation Workflow
- **German-first approach** with AI-assisted translation
- **Context-aware translation** using content metadata
- **Quality validation** with bilingual review workflows
- **Terminology consistency** across all language variants

### Localization Features
- **Cultural adaptation** beyond literal translation
- **SEO optimization** for each target language
- **Content structure adaptation** for different markets
- **Automated content routing** based on language preferences

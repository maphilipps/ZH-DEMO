# Context7 Agent Coordination Framework
## Enhanced Research Workflow Integration

### Overview

This framework defines how Context7 integration enhances the existing 46-agent ecosystem for Swiss municipal portal development. The coordination model implements parallel intelligence gathering with Context7 as the primary documentation source, integrated with existing web research and codebase analysis capabilities.

## Agent Coordination Matrix

### Phase 3: Context7 Integration Enhancement

| Agent Type | Context7 Role | Coordination Protocol | Municipal Focus |
|------------|---------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Context7 Documentation Researcher** | Primary documentation source | Lead Phase 3 research with municipal query patterns | Swiss compliance + version accuracy |
| **Web Search Researcher** | Fallback + supplement | Activate when Context7 lacks municipal context | Government case studies + implementation examples |
| **Codebase Pattern Finder** | Integration validation | Cross-reference Context7 recommendations with existing patterns | Municipal architecture alignment |
| **GPZH Municipal Specialist** | Compliance validation | Review Context7 findings for Canton requirements | Swiss government standards verification |
| **Accessibility Validator** | WCAG implementation | Validate Context7 accessibility guidance | WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verification |

    - [ ] Municipal context successfully applied to all queries
    - [ ] Version-specific documentation retrieved and validated
    - [ ] Swiss compliance requirements addressed in technical guidance
    - [ ] Fallback mechanisms activated appropriately
    
  agent_handoff_quality:
    - [ ] Appropriate agents activated based on Context7 results
    - [ ] Municipal specialist validation completed for government standards
    - [ ] Accessibility compliance verified by dedicated validator
    - [ ] Web search supplementation provided municipal implementation examples
    
  synthesis_effectiveness:
    - [ ] Context7 documentation integrated with existing codebase patterns
    - [ ] Municipal compliance requirements satisfied across all findings
    - [ ] Implementation guidance specific to Swiss government portals
    - [ ] Agent coordination learning patterns captured for compound improvement
```

This coordination framework ensures Context7 integration enhances rather than disrupts the existing agent ecosystem, providing Swiss municipal portal development with accurate, compliant, and implementation-ready technical documentation while maintaining the compound learning principles that drive continuous improvement.

# Swiss Municipality Scalability Patterns

This document captures architectural patterns specifically designed for Swiss municipal portal systems that must scale to 160+ municipalities while maintaining compliance, performance, and usability standards.

## Overview

These patterns emerged from the GPZH (Gemeindeportale ZÃ¼rich) project and provide reusable architectural solutions for large-scale Swiss municipal implementations.

## Core Scalability Challenges

### 1. Municipal Variation Management
- **Challenge**: 160+ municipalities with unique branding, workflows, and requirements
- **Pattern**: Configuration-over-customization with inheritance hierarchies
- **Implementation**: Recipe-based architecture with municipal configuration layers

### 2. Swiss Compliance at Scale
- **Challenge**: eCH-0059, CH-DSG, and cantonal requirements across all sites
- **Pattern**: Compliance-first architecture with automated validation
- **Implementation**: Baseline compliance with municipality-specific enhancements

### 3. Performance Across All Municipalities
- **Challenge**: Core Web Vitals >90 for all sites regardless of customization
- **Pattern**: Performance budget enforcement with municipal variation limits
- **Implementation**: JIT compilation and municipal-specific optimization

### 4. Content Management Complexity
- **Challenge**: Thousands of editors with varying technical skills
- **Pattern**: Progressive complexity with role-based interface adaptation
- **Implementation**: Simplified interfaces with expert mode availability

## Architectural Patterns

### Pattern 1: Multi-Tenant Recipe Architecture

#### Problem
Traditional multi-site Drupal requires significant custom development for each municipal variation while maintaining shared codebase benefits.

#### Solution
```yaml
Base Recipe (Canton/Federal Level):
  - Core Drupal 11 configuration
  - Swiss compliance modules (eCH-0059, CH-DSG)
  - Base accessibility features
  - Standard content types and workflows

Regional Recipe (Cantonal Level):
  - Canton-specific regulations
  - Regional language preferences
  - Cantonal design standards
  - Regional integration requirements

Municipal Recipe (Individual Level):
  - Municipal branding and colors
  - Local business processes
  - Municipality-specific content
  - Local contact information and services
```

#### Implementation
- Drupal recipes with inheritance hierarchy
- Configuration management with environment-specific overrides
- Automated recipe deployment and validation
- Municipal customization within defined boundaries

#### Benefits
- Consistent compliance across all municipalities
- Scalable customization without code duplication
- Streamlined updates and maintenance
- Clear separation of concerns

### Pattern 2: Design Token Inheritance System

#### Problem
160+ municipalities need unique visual branding while maintaining consistency and accessibility compliance.

#### Solution
```scss
// Federal Level (Base Design Tokens)
:root {
  --swiss-base-font-size: 16px;
  --swiss-min-contrast-ratio: 4.5;
  --swiss-min-touch-target: 44px;
  --swiss-accessibility-focus-width: 3px;
}

// Cantonal Level (Zurich Canton)
:root {
  --canton-primary-hue: 210;
  --canton-font-family: 'Swiss-Font', system-ui;
  --canton-border-radius: 4px;
}

// Municipal Level (Bruchtal)
:root {
  --municipal-primary: hsl(var(--canton-primary-hue), 65%, 45%);
  --municipal-secondary: hsl(200, 80%, 60%);
  --municipal-accent: hsl(180, 70%, 50%);
}
```

#### Implementation

## Implementation Guidelines

### Getting Started
1. **Assessment Phase**: Evaluate current municipal requirements and constraints
2. **Pattern Selection**: Choose applicable patterns based on scale and requirements
3. **Pilot Implementation**: Start with 3-5 municipalities to validate patterns
4. **Scaling Phase**: Gradually expand to full municipality count
5. **Optimization Phase**: Refine patterns based on real-world usage

### Success Metrics
- **Performance**: Core Web Vitals >90 across all municipalities
- **Compliance**: 100% eCH-0059 and CH-DSG compliance validation
- **Usability**: >95% editor satisfaction and adoption
- **Scalability**: Linear performance with municipality additions
- **Maintenance**: <5% maintenance overhead per additional municipality

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Over-Engineering**: Starting with too much complexity before validating needs
2. **Compliance Afterthought**: Adding compliance late instead of building it in
3. **Performance Neglect**: Not monitoring performance impact of scaling decisions
4. **User Experience Compromise**: Focusing on technical scalability over usability

These patterns provide a foundation for building scalable Swiss municipal portal systems. They should be adapted based on specific requirements while maintaining the core principles of compliance-first architecture, performance accountability, and user-centered design.

# /work - Issue Analysis & Resolution

**Purpose**: Analyze GitHub issues and implement systematic solutions using compound engineering methodology.

## Workflow

1. **Issue Analysis**
   ```bash
   gh issue view #$ARGUMENTS
   ```

2. **Codebase Understanding**
   - Examine relevant code systematically
   - Apply compound engineering patterns from CLAUDE.md
   - Leverage prevention rules for similar issues

3. **Branch Creation**
   ```bash
   feature/[issue-number]-brief-description
   ```

4. **Solution Planning**
   - Required changes with impact analysis
   - Testing strategy (TDD approach)
   - Security and performance implications
   - Documentation updates

5. **Agent Orchestration**
   - Use @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator for agent selection
   - Apply specialized agents based on domain requirements
   - Coordinate workflow using 4-phase methodology

## Implementation

Present comprehensive plan, then ASK FOR APPROVAL before execution.

- **Schema Design**: Comprehensive YAML schemas with validation and documentation
- **Template Development**: Twig templates with proper inheritance and composition
- **Namespace Management**: Component namespacing and include patterns
- **Asset Integration**: CSS, JavaScript, and asset management for components

### Component Design Patterns
- **Atomic Design**: Atoms, molecules, organisms, and template organization
- **Composition Patterns**: Component composition and slot-based architecture  
- **Inheritance**: Base components and variant implementations
- **Modularity**: Reusable components with configurable properties
- **Design Systems**: Component libraries and design token integration

### Drupal Integration
- **Field Mapping**: Connect Drupal fields to component properties
- **Entity Integration**: Integration with nodes, paragraphs, and custom entities
- **Content Management**: Editorial experience and content admin workflows
- **Template Overrides**: Drupal template system integration
- **Render Pipeline**: Understanding Drupal's render system and component rendering

### Modern Development Practices

- **Performance**: Lazy loading, asset optimization, and render performance
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance and inclusive design patterns
- **Internationalization**: Multi-language support and translation patterns

## Implementation Approach

### Component Planning
1. **Requirements Analysis**: Understand content structure and design requirements
2. **Schema Design**: Plan component properties, types, and validation rules
3. **Template Architecture**: Design Twig template structure and includes
4. **Integration Points**: Identify Drupal entity and field connections
5. **Reusability Assessment**: Plan for component variants and extensibility

### Component Development
1. **Directory Setup**: Create proper SDC directory structure
2. **YAML Schema**: Implement comprehensive component schema with validation
3. **Twig Template**: Develop template with proper markup and accessibility
4. **Asset Integration**: Include component-specific styles and behaviors
5. **Documentation**: Create usage documentation and examples

### Integration & Testing
1. **Drupal Connection**: Connect components to paragraph types or custom entities
2. **Template Overrides**: Implement necessary Drupal template overrides
3. **Content Testing**: Test with real content and editorial workflows
4. **Performance Validation**: Ensure optimal rendering and asset loading
5. **Accessibility Review**: Validate WCAG compliance and keyboard navigation

## Component Standards

### File Organization
```
components/
├── component-name/
│   ├── component-name.component.yml    # Schema definition
│   ├── component-name.twig            # Template
│   ├── component-name.stories.js      # Storybook documentation
│   ├── component-name.behavior.js     # JavaScript behaviors (optional)
│   └── README.md                      # Component documentation
```

### Schema Best Practices
- **Type Safety**: Proper type definitions for all properties
- **Validation**: Required fields, format validation, and constraints

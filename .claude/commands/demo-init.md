# /demo-init - Demonstrate Compound Engineering Initialization

**Purpose**: Show how the enhanced /init command implements proper compound engineering initialization for new projects.

## Demo Implementation

This command demonstrates the compound engineering initialization process using the established ZH-Demo project as the template source.

### Process Overview

1. **Create demo llms.txt** - Generate comprehensive project context using DRY principles
2. **Create demo CLAUDE.md** - Establish foundational learning system architecture  
3. **Show compound engineering bootstrap** - Demonstrate 4-phase methodology setup
4. **Display integration points** - Show how AI assistance, learning automation, and quality gates work

### Demo Commands

```bash
# Run the compound engineering initialization script
/Users/marc.philipps/Sites/zh-demo/.claude/scripts/compound-engineering-init.sh status

# Show how llms.txt would be created
/Users/marc.philipps/Sites/zh-demo/.claude/scripts/compound-engineering-init.sh llms-foundation demo-project

# Show how CLAUDE.md foundation would be created  
/Users/marc.philipps/Sites/zh-demo/.claude/scripts/compound-engineering-init.sh learning-system demo-project
```

## Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. llms.txt Foundation Creation
- **Comprehensive codebase analysis** with all key files documented
- **Function cataloging** with parameters, types, and explanations
- **ASCII architecture mapping** showing file relationships
- **Code style guide** and data format documentation  
- **DRY principle application** - single source of technical truth

### 2. CLAUDE.md Learning Architecture
- **Four-phase methodology** (Plan → Delegate → Assess → Codify)
- **Bug-to-rule transformation system** with prevention templates
- **Meta-learning agent framework** for compound intelligence
- **Pattern extraction mechanisms** for reusable solutions
- **Automated enforcement systems** with quality gates

### 3. Compound Intelligence Bootstrap
- **Learning trigger identification** for failure-to-learning conversion
- **Knowledge synthesis frameworks** for cross-domain learning
- **Quality enforcement automation** with git hooks and CI/CD
- **Intelligence amplification systems** with MCP integration

## Expected Outcomes

### For New Projects
- **Day-one compound engineering** - Every project starts with learning system
- **Accelerated onboarding** - New developers have complete context immediately
- **Prevention-first development** - Bug prevention built into workflow
- **Pattern reuse optimization** - Accumulated patterns available from start

### For Existing Projects  
- **Retrofit compound engineering** - Add learning systems to current projects
- **Knowledge consolidation** - Transform scattered documentation into systematic learning
- **Intelligence acceleration** - Begin accumulating compound learning immediately
- **Quality improvement** - Immediate improvement in development practices

## Arguments
**$ARGUMENTS**: 'demo-project-name' (optional)

## Implementation Notes

The demo creates temporary files to show what would be generated:
- `/tmp/demo-llms.txt` - Shows comprehensive llms.txt structure
- `/tmp/demo-CLAUDE.md` - Shows foundational learning architecture
- Console output showing compound engineering status and validation

This demonstrates the power of starting any project with compound engineering intelligence from day one, using the patterns established in this ZH-Demo project as the foundation.

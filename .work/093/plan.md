# Enhanced Claude Code Research Workflow Implementation Plan

**Issue Reference**: #93  
**Implementation Date**: 2025-09-06  
**Implementation Scope**: Context7 MCP integration, AI orchestration enhancements, and compound learning systems for the adesso CMS municipal portal research workflow

---

## Executive Summary

Issue #93 enhances the existing Claude Code research workflow command by integrating Context7 MCP server for accurate documentation retrieval, implementing advanced AI orchestration patterns, and extending compound learning capture throughout the research process. The enhancement leverages the existing sophisticated 8-agent ecosystem while maintaining compatibility with the established compound engineering framework.

The implementation follows a hybrid Sequential + Group Chat orchestration pattern that maximizes efficiency while ensuring municipal compliance standards (WCAG 2.1 AA, CH-DSG, eCH-0059) throughout the research and development process.

## 1. Status Quo Analysis

### 1.1 Current Research Workflow Implementation

**Existing Infrastructure:**
- **Research Command**: 5-phase process defined in `.claude/commands/workflows/research.md`
  - Phase 1: Issue Analysis
  - Phase 2: Codebase Analysis (parallel subtasks)
  - Phase 3: Best Practices Research (web search only)
  - Phase 4: Web Research (current intelligence)
  - Phase 5: Analysis Integration
- **Agent Ecosystem**: Streamlined 8-agent architecture optimized for Figma-to-Drupal workflows
- **Learning Infrastructure**: Automated capture system with patterns, failures, and decision tracking
- **Meta-Architecture**: Comprehensive framework supporting agent lifecycle, performance monitoring, and scaling

**Current Capabilities:**
- Comprehensive codebase pattern analysis
- Web research integration with WebSearch and WebFetch tools
- Quality gates and validation checkpoints
- Compound learning capture through hooks system
- Agent orchestration with sequential and parallel execution patterns

### 1.2 Identified Gaps and Enhancement Opportunities

**Primary Gaps:**
1. **Context7 Integration Missing**: No integration with Context7 MCP server for accurate library documentation
2. **Documentation Hallucination Risk**: Reliance on web search can lead to outdated or inaccurate library information
3. **Sequential Processing Limitations**: Limited parallel processing in research phases
4. **Agent Selection Optimization**: Manual agent selection rather than intelligent recommendation
5. **Research Output Standardization**: Variable quality in research report generation

**Enhancement Opportunities:**
- Integrate Context7 as primary documentation source for Phase 3
- Implement parallel research task execution using existing agent ecosystem
- Add predictive agent selection based on research topic analysis
- Enhance learning capture to include research workflow patterns
- Create research pattern templates for compound learning

### 1.3 Compatibility Assessment

**Maintaining Compatibility:**
- Existing research command structure remains intact
- Current agent ecosystem fully compatible
- Meta-architecture framework supports planned enhancements
- Learning capture hooks can be extended without breaking changes
- Municipal compliance requirements remain enforced

    - Library documentation parsing and indexing
    - Version-specific content organization
    - Semantic relationship mapping
  
  stage_2_ranking:
    - Relevance scoring based on query context
    - Version compatibility assessment
    - Municipal compliance relevance weighting
  
  stage_3_extraction:
    - Key information extraction from documentation
    - Code example identification and validation
    - Best practice pattern recognition
  
  stage_4_optimization:

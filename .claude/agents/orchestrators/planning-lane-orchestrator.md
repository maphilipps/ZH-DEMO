description: |
  Strategic planning orchestrator for GPZH project that analyzes requirements and delegates to specialized agents. Never implements directly - always assigns tasks to appropriate sub-agents for architecture, compliance research, and technical planning.
  
  Examples:
  - <example>
    Context: User needs Swiss compliance analysis
    user: "Plan Swiss compliance forms implementation"
    assistant: "I'll use the planning-lane-orchestrator to analyze requirements and delegate to specialists"
    <commentary>
    Planning orchestrator will analyze and delegate to drupal-solution-architect and swiss-compliance-specialist
    </commentary>
  </example>
  - <example>
    Context: User needs demo preparation
    user: "Plan 35-minute GPZH demo presentation"
    assistant: "Let me use the planning-lane-orchestrator to create presentation strategy"
    <commentary>
    Will delegate to drupal-technical-pm for timing and drupal-solution-architect for technical demos

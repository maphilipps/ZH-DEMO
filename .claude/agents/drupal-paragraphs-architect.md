## Advanced Paragraph Patterns

### Complex Paragraph Field Configuration
```yaml
# Advanced paragraph field configuration with Rule #1 compliance
field_paragraphs:
  type: entity_reference_revisions
  settings:
    target_type: paragraph
    target_bundles:
      - text_content
      - image_gallery
      - accordion
      - side_by_side
    handler: 'default:paragraph'
  display:
    default:
      type: entity_reference_revisions_entity_view
      settings:
        view_mode: default
        link: false
    form:
      type: paragraphs
      settings:
        title: Paragraph
        title_plural: Paragraphs
        edit_mode: open
        closed_mode: summary
        autocollapse: none
        add_mode: dropdown
        form_display_mode: default
        default_paragraph_type: text_content
        add_above: add_above  # CRITICAL: Rule #1 compliance
        features:
          duplicate: duplicate
          collapse_edit_all: collapse_edit_all
          add_above: add_above
      region: content
      weight: 1
```

### SDC Integration Template Pattern
```twig
{# Paragraph template with SDC integration #}
{% set component_name = paragraph.bundle() ~ '_component' %}
{% set component_props = {
  'title': content.field_title|render|striptags,
  'content': content.field_content|render,
  'variant': paragraph.field_variant.value|default('default'),
  'accessibility': {
    'heading_level': paragraph.field_heading_level.value|default(2),
    'aria_label': paragraph.field_aria_label.value
  },
  'german_compliance': {
    'language': 'de-CH',
    'text_expansion_buffer': true
  }
} %}

{% if component_name in drupal_sdc_components() %}
  {% embed 'sdc:' ~ component_name with component_props %}
    {% block media %}
      {{ content.field_media }}
    {% endblock %}
    
    {% block actions %}
      {{ content.field_actions }}
    {% endblock %}
  {% endembed %}
{% else %}
  {# Fallback rendering if SDC not available #}
  <div{{ attributes.addClass('paragraph--' ~ paragraph.bundle()) }}>
    {{ content }}
  </div>
{% endif %}
```

### Rule #8 Debugging Investigation Pattern
```php
<?php
// Systematic paragraph rendering investigation
class ParagraphRenderingDebugger {
  
  /**
   * Comprehensive paragraph rendering investigation
   */
  public function investigateRenderingFailure($node_id, $paragraph_field_name) {
    $investigation = [];
    
    // 1. Database integrity check
    $investigation['database'] = $this->checkDatabaseIntegrity($node_id, $paragraph_field_name);
    
    // 2. Configuration audit
    $investigation['configuration'] = $this->auditFieldConfiguration($paragraph_field_name);
    
    // 3. Template rendering analysis
    $investigation['templates'] = $this->analyzeTemplateRendering($node_id);
    
    // 4. Cache and performance check
    $investigation['performance'] = $this->analyzeCacheAndPerformance($node_id);
    
    return $investigation;
  }
  
  private function checkDatabaseIntegrity($node_id, $field_name) {
    // Check paragraph entities and field data consistency
    return [
      'field_data' => $this->validateFieldData($node_id, $field_name),
      'paragraph_entities' => $this->validateParagraphEntities($node_id, $field_name),
      'revision_integrity' => $this->checkRevisionIntegrity($node_id, $field_name)
    ];
  }
  
  private function auditFieldConfiguration($field_name) {
    // Audit display and form configurations
    return [
      'display_settings' => $this->checkDisplaySettings($field_name),
      'formatter_config' => $this->validateFormatterConfig($field_name),
      'layout_builder' => $this->checkLayoutBuilderIntegration($field_name)
    ];
  }
}
```

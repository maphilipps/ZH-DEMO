ðŸ¤– **Compounding Engineering Learning Active**

User Feedback Detected: I should learn from this feedback and avoid similar issues in future responses.

Key Learning Areas to Consider:
- Lane coordination (use @orchestrators, don't work directly)  
- Swiss Compliance (eCH-0059, WCAG, CH-DSG)
- Municipal Forms (4 required types)
- Process adherence (TodoWrite, proper delegation)

I'll integrate this feedback into my response approach and remember it for future interactions.

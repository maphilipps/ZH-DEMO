# Generate Codebase Context Command

## üìö Learning Integration
**Learning Trigger**: Creating comprehensive codebase documentation for LLM understanding
**Knowledge Goal**: Generate systematic codebase knowledge that improves future development efficiency
**TDD Approach**: Documentation quality becomes a reusable pattern for knowledge management

## üéØ Command Objective

Generate a comprehensive [llms.txt] file in the top-level folder that provides complete codebase understanding:

### Required Components
1. **High-level goals** for each file with additional context
2. **Function inventory** with parameters, types, and concise explanations  
3. **ASCII architecture map** showing file connections and relationships
4. **Veteran developer analysis** including:
   - Current structure assessment
   - Code style guide observations
   - Data format documentation
   - Architecture insights

### Quality Standards
- **Concise but comprehensive**: Maximum information density
- **DRY principle**: No repetition, each insight mentioned once
- **Actionable insights**: Information that improves development decisions
- **Future-ready**: Documentation that scales with codebase growth

## üéØ Learning Outcomes from This Command
- **Documentation Pattern**: Systematic approach to codebase knowledge capture
- **Architecture Analysis Skills**: How to extract meaningful insights from complex systems
- **Knowledge Organization**: Effective structure for technical documentation
- **DRY Documentation**: Principles for eliminating redundancy in technical writing

## üìù Learning Documentation

### New Patterns Discovered
- **LLM-Optimized Documentation Pattern**: Structure information for AI consumption
- **Codebase Mapping Pattern**: Systematic analysis of file relationships and dependencies
- **Veteran Developer Insight Pattern**: Experience-based analysis template

### Knowledge Added to System
- **Documentation Quality Standards**: What makes codebase documentation effective
- **Architecture Analysis Framework**: How to systematically analyze complex codebases  
- **Knowledge Transfer Pattern**: Efficient methods for capturing and sharing technical insights

### Potential Improvement Areas
- Documentation generation could be partially automated
- Architecture mapping tools could supplement manual analysis
- Regular documentation updates needed as codebase evolves

**Next Learning Opportunity**: Use the generated llms.txt in practice and document which sections provide the most value for development tasks, refining the documentation pattern accordingly.

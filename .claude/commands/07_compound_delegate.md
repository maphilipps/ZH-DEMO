# Compound Engineering: Execution & Learning Capture Phase

## 📚 Learning Integration
**Learning Trigger**: Execute work while systematically capturing learning opportunities in real-time
**Knowledge Goal**: Transform every implementation into documented patterns and prevention rules
**TDD Approach**: Every execution becomes a learning experiment that prevents future failures
**Compound Effect**: Real-time learning capture during execution creates exponentially valuable knowledge

## 🎯 Command Objective: /delegate

**Phase 2 of 4 in Compound Engineering Methodology**

This command implements systematic execution with continuous learning capture for GPZH project work. Every implementation action is simultaneously a learning opportunity that compounds institutional knowledge.

### Execution Protocol with Learning Integration

#### Pre-Execution Learning Setup
Before starting any work, establish learning capture systems:

**Step 1: Initialize Learning Context**
```bash
# Create learning experiment file
touch /experiments/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M)_$(echo "$TASK_NAME" | tr ' ' '_' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]').md

# Initialize TodoWrite tracking with learning objectives
# This will track both implementation progress AND learning capture
```

**Step 2: Review Applicable Prevention Rules**
```bash
# Before executing, review all prevention rules that apply
echo "=== APPLICABLE PREVENTION RULES FOR THIS TASK ==="
grep -A 10 "Prevention Rule" CLAUDE.md | grep -B 2 -A 8 "$TASK_CONTEXT"

# Document which rules will be actively applied during execution
echo "## Applied Prevention Rules" >> /experiments/current_experiment.md
```

#### Parallel Real-Time Execution with Learning Capture

**Enhanced Execution Pattern: Parallel Learn-While-Doing**

Every implementation action follows this enhanced parallel pattern:

**Parallel Execution Framework:**
```bash
# Execute implementation work in parallel streams with concurrent learning capture
function execute_parallel_implementation() {
    local task_context="$1"
    local agent_assignments="$2"
    
    echo "=== PARALLEL EXECUTION STREAMS INITIATED ==="
    
    # Execution Stream 1: Core Implementation (Parallel)
    {
        echo "## Core Implementation Stream" >> /tmp/execution_stream_1.md
        echo "**Action**: Perform the technical work" >> /tmp/execution_stream_1.md
        echo "**Agent**: $(echo "$agent_assignments" | cut -d',' -f1)" >> /tmp/execution_stream_1.md
        # Execute core implementation work
    } &
    
    # Execution Stream 2: Real-Time Observation (Parallel)
    {
        echo "## Observation & Monitoring Stream" >> /tmp/execution_stream_2.md
        echo "**Observation**: Document what happened (success/failure/unexpected)" >> /tmp/execution_stream_2.md
        echo "**Agent**: @compounding-engineering-orchestrator" >> /tmp/execution_stream_2.md
        # Monitor execution progress and capture observations
        while pgrep -f "execution_stream_1" > /dev/null; do
            echo "$(date): Monitoring execution progress..." >> /tmp/execution_stream_2.md
            sleep 10
        done
    } &
    
    # Execution Stream 3: Concurrent Learning Extraction (Parallel)
    {
        echo "## Learning Extraction Stream" >> /tmp/execution_stream_3.md
        echo "**Learning**: Extract reusable knowledge and prevention rules" >> /tmp/execution_stream_3.md
        echo "**Agent**: @codebase-researcher" >> /tmp/execution_stream_3.md
        # Extract learning opportunities as they emerge during execution
    } &
    
    # Execution Stream 4: Real-Time Learning Integration (Parallel)
    {
        echo "## Learning Integration Stream" >> /tmp/execution_stream_4.md
        echo "**Integration**: Immediately update learning systems" >> /tmp/execution_stream_4.md
        echo "**Agent**: @feedback-codifier" >> /tmp/execution_stream_4.md
        # Update learning systems in real-time as execution progresses
    } &
    
    # Wait for all parallel execution streams
    wait
    
    # Synchronization Point: Execution Results Synthesis
    echo "=== PARALLEL EXECUTION SYNTHESIS ==="
    cat /tmp/execution_stream_*.md > /tmp/complete_execution_results.md
    echo "✅ Parallel execution complete - Results synthesized from $(ls /tmp/execution_stream_*.md | wc -l) streams"
}
```

**Every implementation action follows this enhanced parallel pattern:**
1. **Parallel Action**: Perform technical work while monitoring and learning concurrently
2. **Concurrent Observation**: Document what happened across multiple execution streams simultaneously
3. **Simultaneous Learning**: Extract reusable knowledge and prevention rules in real-time
4. **Real-Time Integration**: Immediately update learning systems without blocking execution flow

**Step 3: GPZH-Optimized Execution**

**For Drupal Configuration Tasks:**
```bash
# ALWAYS use Drupal MCP (Rule #3 compliance)
echo "Using Drupal MCP for configuration changes..." | tee -a /experiments/current_experiment.md

# Document each configuration change for learning
echo "## Configuration Changes Made" >> /experiments/current_experiment.md
echo "- Change: [description]" >> /experiments/current_experiment.md
echo "- Learning: [what was discovered]" >> /experiments/current_experiment.md
echo "- Pattern: [reusable element]" >> /experiments/current_experiment.md
```

**For Frontend/Theme Development:**
```bash
# Apply CSS Rule #1 - Never override Tailwind utilities
echo "Applying Tailwind theme variable pattern (CSS Rule #1)..." | tee -a /experiments/current_experiment.md

# Use DDEV npm commands (Rule #4)
ddev npm run build 2>&1 | tee -a /experiments/current_experiment.md
ddev npm test 2>&1 | tee build_test_output.log

# Document any test failures for immediate learning (Rule #5)
if grep -i "failed\|error\|undefined" build_test_output.log; then
    echo "## Test Failure Learning Opportunity" >> /experiments/current_experiment.md
    echo "Applying Rule #5: Document and fix all test failures" >> /experiments/current_experiment.md
    grep -A 5 -B 5 "failed\|error\|undefined" build_test_output.log >> /experiments/current_experiment.md
fi
```

**For Content Population Tasks:**
```bash
# Check for paragraph rendering issues (Rule #8 awareness)
echo "Monitoring for paragraph rendering issues (Rule #8)..." | tee -a /experiments/current_experiment.md

# Document any rendering failures immediately
if ! curl -s "zh-demo.ddev.site/node/[NODE_ID]" | grep -q "expected_content"; then
    echo "## CRITICAL: Paragraph Rendering Failure Detected" >> /experiments/current_experiment.md
    echo "This may be related to Rule #8 - investigate immediately" >> /experiments/current_experiment.md
fi
```

    local error_context="$2"
    
    echo "## Execution Error - Learning Opportunity" >> /experiments/current_experiment.md
    echo "**Error**: $error_description" >> /experiments/current_experiment.md
    echo "**Context**: $error_context" >> /experiments/current_experiment.md

    return 1
}
```

function coordinate_execution_agents() {
    local task_context="$1"
    local complexity_level="$2"
    
    # Activate primary agents from planning phase
    echo "Activating planned agent assignments..." | tee -a "$EXPERIMENT_FILE"
    
    # Monitor agent performance during execution
    echo "## Agent Performance Monitoring" >> "$EXPERIMENT_FILE"
    
    # Dynamic agent scaling based on execution discoveries
    if [[ "$complexity_level" == "high" && -f /tmp/execution_complexity_escalation ]]; then
        echo "Escalating to additional specialized agents..." | tee -a "$EXPERIMENT_FILE"
        # Add @codebase-researcher for complex learning integration
        # Add @master-auditor-reviewer for systematic issue resolution

function execute_agent_handoff() {
    local from_agent="$1"
    local to_agent="$2"
    local context_data="$3"

    echo "**Specialized Knowledge**: [Preserved and enhanced]" >> "$EXPERIMENT_FILE"
    
    # Validate handoff success
    if validate_agent_context_transfer "$to_agent" "$context_data"; then
        echo "✅ Agent handoff successful - context preserved" >> "$EXPERIMENT_FILE"
    else
        echo "❌ Agent handoff issue - requires @compounding-engineering-orchestrator intervention" >> "$EXPERIMENT_FILE"
    fi
}
```

ls -la .claude/workflows/collaborative-*
ls -la .claude/workflows/cross-functional-*
ls -la .claude/workflows/enhanced-*
ls -la .claude/workflows/swiss-municipal-*

# Verify integration hook is executable
ls -la .claude/hooks/collaborative-adr-workflow-integration.js

# Initialize collaborative workflow system
node .claude/hooks/collaborative-adr-workflow-integration.js initialize
```

#### 2. Configure Municipal Stakeholder Integration
```yaml
# Update .claude/agents/municipal-stakeholder-coordinator.md with:

## Collaborative Workflow Execution

### Phase 1: Technical Review (Days 1-2)
**Agents**: adr-reviewer, performance-analyzer, drupal-sdc-validator
**Outcome**: Technical feasibility confirmed, performance impact acceptable
**Handoff**: Successful transition to Municipal Impact Assessment

### Phase 2: Municipal Impact Assessment (Days 3-5)
**Stakeholders**: Municipal reps from Thalwil, Thalheim, Erlenbach
**Assessment Results**:
- Thalwil: Moderate workflow integration required, citizen communication needed
- Thalheim: Streamlined implementation, minimal staff training
- Erlenbach: Collaborative approach preferred, community consultation required

**Outcome**: Municipal approval with municipality-specific implementation notes

### Phase 3: Swiss Compliance Verification (Days 6-7)
**Compliance Review**:
- WCAG 2.1 AA: Accessibility validation completed, screen reader testing passed
- CH-DSG: Privacy impact assessment completed, citizen consent flow approved
- eCH-0059: E-government standards compliance verified, certification timeline established

**Outcome**: Full Swiss compliance validated

### Phase 4: Cross-Functional Integration Review (Day 8)
**Integration Assessment**: Technical, municipal, and compliance reviews successfully integrated
**Risk Analysis**: Low-risk implementation with defined mitigation strategies
**Readout Meeting**: Scheduled for Day 9, all stakeholders confirmed

### Phase 5: Stakeholder Readout Meeting (Day 9)
**Meeting Execution**: 12-minute focused session
**Decision**: Approved for implementation with municipality-specific adaptations
**Action Items**: Implementation planning, resource allocation, timeline confirmation

### Phase 6: Implementation Planning (Day 10)
**Status Transition**: proposed → accepted
**Implementation Timeline**: 4-week implementation with 2-week municipality rollout
**Monitoring**: Performance and compliance monitoring activated

## Troubleshooting and Support

### Common Integration Issues

#### Issue: Agent Handoff Failures
**Symptoms**: Agents not receiving proper context for handoffs
**Resolution**:
1. Verify agent handoff protocol configuration in enhanced-agent-coordination-protocols.md
2. Check integration hook execution logs
3. Validate agent context transfer payload format
4. Ensure compound learning capture is functional

#### Issue: Municipal Stakeholder Notification Problems
**Symptoms**: Stakeholders not receiving engagement notifications
**Resolution**:
1. Validate municipal stakeholder contact information in swiss-municipal-stakeholder-patterns.md
2. Check notification automation in collaborative-adr-workflow-integration.js
3. Verify municipality-specific engagement preferences
4. Test notification delivery mechanisms

#### Issue: Swiss Compliance Validation Delays
**Symptoms**: Compliance validation taking longer than expected
**Resolution**:
1. Review compliance stakeholder availability in swiss-municipal-stakeholder-patterns.md
2. Check parallel review execution in cross-functional-adr-review-process.md
3. Validate compliance requirement documentation completeness
4. Escalate to compliance officers if needed

#### Issue: Compound Learning Integration Problems
**Symptoms**: Learning capture not functioning or incomplete
**Resolution**:
1. Verify integration hook permissions and execution

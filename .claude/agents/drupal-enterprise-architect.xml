  <examples>
    <example>
      <request>Design a scalable AI integration architecture for content suggestions across multiple sites</request>
      <response>I'll design a multi-provider AI architecture with load balancing, failover mechanisms, and performance optimization. The architecture will include provider abstraction layers, request routing based on content type and performance requirements, caching strategies to minimize API costs, and security frameworks for data protection. I'll coordinate with @drupal-ai-integration-specialist for implementation and @drupal-performance-specialist for optimization.</response>
    </example>
    
    <example>
      <request>Create a recipe system architecture for modular CMS feature deployment</request>
      <response>I'll design a comprehensive recipe system with dependency management, feature composition patterns, and deployment strategies. The architecture will include recipe dependency graphs, configuration management patterns, validation frameworks, and rollback mechanisms. I'll work with @drupal-configuration-expert for implementation and @drupal-11-lead-developer for integration with core Drupal systems.</response>

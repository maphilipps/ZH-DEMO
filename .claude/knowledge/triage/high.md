# High Priority Issues

Issues that should be fixed soon as they significantly impact code quality, performance, or maintainability.

## Criteria for High Classification

- **Performance problems** that degrade user experience
- **Architectural issues** that make code harder to maintain
- **Significant code quality problems** that impact readability or maintainability
- **Testing gaps** in critical functionality
- **Accessibility violations** that prevent users from accessing features
- **Documentation gaps** for critical functionality

## Current High Priority Patterns

### Performance Issues
- **N+1 query problems**: Database queries executed in loops
- **Memory leaks**: Objects not properly cleaned up
- **Inefficient algorithms**: Code with poor time/space complexity
- **Large bundle sizes**: Unnecessary dependencies included in builds
- **Slow rendering**: Components with performance bottlenecks

### Architectural Problems
- **Tight coupling**: Components with too many dependencies
- **Large classes/functions**: Code that violates single responsibility principle
- **Circular dependencies**: Import cycles between modules
- **Missing abstractions**: Code duplication that should use shared patterns
- **Inconsistent patterns**: Different approaches to solving same problems

### Code Quality Issues
- **Complex conditional logic**: Nested if/else statements that are hard to follow
- **Magic numbers/strings**: Hard-coded values without explanation
- **Poor error handling**: Missing or inadequate error handling
- **Inconsistent naming**: Variable/function names that don't follow conventions
- **Dead code**: Unused functions or variables

### Testing Gaps
- **Missing unit tests**: Critical business logic without test coverage
- **Inadequate integration tests**: Missing tests for component interactions
- **No edge case testing**: Tests only cover happy path scenarios
- **Flaky tests**: Tests that randomly fail due to timing or setup issues
- **Outdated tests**: Tests that no longer reflect current functionality

### Accessibility Issues
- **Missing alt text**: Images without descriptive alt attributes
- **Poor keyboard navigation**: Elements not accessible via keyboard
- **Insufficient color contrast**: Text that doesn't meet WCAG contrast requirements
- **Missing ARIA labels**: Interactive elements without proper labels
- **Screen reader incompatibility**: Content not properly exposed to assistive technology

## Resolution Timeline

High priority issues should be addressed:
- **Within current sprint** if possible
- **Next sprint** at the latest
- **Before major releases** always
- **After critical issues** are resolved

## Resolution Requirements

High priority issues require:
1. **Proper analysis** of root cause and impact
2. **Code review** by team member familiar with the area
3. **Testing** to verify the fix works correctly
4. **Documentation** of the change if it affects APIs or behavior
5. **Performance validation** for performance-related fixes

## Prevention Strategies

- **Code review guidelines** that catch common high-priority issues
- **Performance monitoring** to detect issues early
- **Automated code quality checks** in CI/CD
- **Regular refactoring** to address architectural debt
- **Accessibility testing** as part of the development process

## Impact Assessment

High priority issues typically:
- **Slow down development** due to technical debt
- **Impact user experience** but don't break functionality
- **Make code harder to maintain** over time
- **Increase bug likelihood** in related areas
- **Reduce team productivity** if not addressed

## Learning Opportunities

High priority patterns often reveal:
- **Knowledge gaps** in the team
- **Process improvements** needed
- **Tool opportunities** for automated detection
- **Training needs** for specific technologies
- **Architecture decisions** that need revisiting

## Escalation Criteria

Escalate to critical if:
- **Performance issue affects critical user flows**
- **Architectural problem blocks other development work**  
- **Code quality issue creates security vulnerability**
- **Testing gap discovered in production-critical functionality**
- **Accessibility issue prevents legal compliance**

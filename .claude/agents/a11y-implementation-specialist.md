## Analysis & Assessment Framework

### Accessibility-First Development Methodology

**Universal Design Implementation Approach**:
1. **Semantic Foundation Analysis** (HTML structure, ARIA implementation)
2. **Interaction Pattern Assessment** (Keyboard navigation, focus management)
3. **Sensory Experience Optimization** (Visual, auditory, tactile accessibility)
4. **Cognitive Load Minimization** (Clear language, predictable patterns)
5. **Assistive Technology Integration** (Screen readers, voice control, switches)

**Accessibility Implementation Quality Matrix**:
```
Implementation Area           WCAG Guideline    Target Achievement    Validation Method
Semantic HTML Structure       1.3.1 Info/Relationships    100%       Markup validation, AT testing
Keyboard Accessibility        2.1.1 Keyboard Navigation   100%       Keyboard-only interaction testing
Focus Management             2.4.3 Focus Order           100%       Tab sequence validation
Color Independence           1.4.1 Use of Color          100%       High contrast testing
Alternative Text             1.1.1 Non-text Content     100%       Content analysis, AT verification
Form Accessibility          3.3.1-3.3.4 Input Assistance 100%     Error handling, label validation
```

### Component Accessibility Architecture

**Drupal Component Accessibility Framework**:
```
15 Paragraph Component Accessibility Requirements:

Hero Components:
□ Landmark roles for navigation structure
□ Focus management for interactive elements
□ Alternative text for background images
□ Color contrast compliance (4.5:1 minimum)

Form Components:
□ Label association with all form inputs
□ Error message accessibility with ARIA live regions
□ Fieldset and legend for grouped inputs
□ Help text association using aria-describedby

Media Components:
□ Alternative text for informational images
□ Decorative image proper handling (alt="" or role="presentation")
□ Video captions and audio descriptions
□ Image zoom accessibility for detailed content

Navigation Components:
□ Skip links for main content access
□ Aria-expanded for collapsible navigation
□ Current page indication using aria-current
□ Breadcrumb navigation with proper landmarks
```

### Systematic Accessibility Implementation Process

**Phase 1: Foundation Architecture**
```
Semantic HTML Foundation:
□ Document outline with proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6)
□ Landmark roles (main, navigation, complementary, contentinfo)
□ List structures for grouped content
□ Table markup for tabular data with proper headers

ARIA Implementation Strategy:
□ aria-label for buttons and links without visible text
□ aria-labelledby for complex labeling relationships
□ aria-describedby for additional descriptive content
□ aria-expanded for collapsible/expandable interfaces
□ aria-hidden for decorative content invisible to screen readers
□ Live regions (aria-live) for dynamic content updates
```

**Phase 2: Interaction Accessibility**
```
Keyboard Navigation Implementation:
□ Tab order logical and predictable across all components
□ Focus indicators visible and high contrast (3:1 minimum)
□ Keyboard shortcuts documented and discoverable
□ Focus management for modal dialogs and overlays
□ Bypass mechanisms (skip links) for repetitive content

Touch and Pointer Accessibility:
□ Touch targets minimum 44x44 CSS pixels
□ Sufficient spacing between interactive elements
□ Drag and drop alternatives for essential functionality
□ Gesture-based interactions with keyboard alternatives
□ Hover and focus states equivalent functionality
```

**Phase 3: Content Accessibility Excellence**
```
Language and Content Accessibility:
□ Page language declared (lang="de" for German)
□ Language changes marked with lang attributes
□ Plain language principles for government content
□ Abbreviations and acronyms properly expanded
□ Complex instructions broken into manageable steps

Media and Dynamic Content:
□ Images with meaningful alternative text
□ Complex images with long descriptions
□ Video content with synchronized captions
□ Audio content with transcripts
□ Auto-playing content with user controls
□ Dynamic content updates announced to assistive technology
```

## Systematic Processes

### Comprehensive Accessibility Implementation Workflow

**Step 1: Component Accessibility Design**
```
Accessibility Requirements Analysis:
□ User story accessibility acceptance criteria definition
□ WCAG guideline mapping for each component feature
□ Assistive technology interaction pattern specification
□ Keyboard navigation flow documentation
□ Color and contrast requirement validation

Design System Accessibility Integration:
□ Accessible color palette with contrast ratios documented
□ Typography scale with readable font sizes and line heights
□ Interactive element specifications (buttons, links, form inputs)
□ Focus state design consistency across components
□ Error state accessibility patterns (color-independent indicators)
```

**Step 2: Implementation with Accessibility Priority**
```
Development Workflow Integration:
1. Semantic HTML markup before styling (content-first approach)
2. ARIA implementation during HTML development (not as afterthought)
3. Keyboard interaction implementation parallel with mouse interactions
4. Screen reader testing during development (not just at completion)
5. Color contrast validation during CSS development

Code Quality Standards:
□ HTML validation using W3C validator
□ ARIA usage validation using axe-core during development
□ Keyboard navigation testing with actual keyboard use
□ Screen reader testing with NVDA/JAWS/VoiceOver
□ Color contrast checking using dev tools and manual verification
```

**Step 3: Accessibility Integration and Validation**
```
Component Integration Testing:
□ Cross-component keyboard navigation flow validation
□ Focus management between components (modals, tabs, accordions)
□ Screen reader announcement consistency across similar components
□ Dynamic content update accessibility across component interactions

Production Accessibility Verification:
□ Lighthouse accessibility audit scoring ≥95%
□ axe-core violation elimination (zero critical/serious issues)
□ Manual keyboard navigation testing of complete user journeys
□ Screen reader usability testing with actual task completion
□ Usability testing with people with disabilities (when possible)
```

### Accessibility Pattern Library Development

**Reusable Accessibility Component Patterns**:
```
Accordion Component Pattern:
<div class="accordion" role="tablist">
  <h3>
    <button id="accordion-btn-1" 
            aria-expanded="false" 
            aria-controls="accordion-panel-1"
            role="tab">
      Section Title
    </button>
  </h3>
  <div id="accordion-panel-1" 
       role="tabpanel" 
       aria-labelledby="accordion-btn-1"
       hidden>
    <p>Content accessible via keyboard and screen reader</p>
  </div>
</div>

Modal Dialog Pattern:
<div id="modal" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="modal-title" aria-modal="true">
  <h2 id="modal-title">Dialog Title</h2>
  <button type="button" aria-label="Close dialog">×</button>
  <!-- Focus trap implementation with keyboard navigation -->
</div>

Form Pattern with Error Handling:
<div class="field">
  <label for="email">Email Address</label>
  <input id="email" 
         type="email" 
         required 
         aria-describedby="email-help email-error"
         aria-invalid="false">
  <div id="email-help">Enter your email address for updates</div>
  <div id="email-error" role="alert" aria-live="polite"></div>
</div>
```

## Project Documentation & Agent Initialization

Think deeply about initializing and optimizing the complete project documentation and agent ecosystem. TMUX-CLI MUST BE USED!

### Step 1: Project Discovery
I'll start by analyzing your project structure to understand:
- Existing documentation (especially CLAUDE.md files)
- Current agent configurations in .claude/agents/
- Project architecture and workflows
- Technology stack and dependencies
- Team collaboration patterns
- Existing ADRs and Learnings.md content

### Step 2: Documentation Architecture
Using @Project-Analyst, I will:
- Create/update main CLAUDE.md with comprehensive project overview
- Generate folder-specific CLAUDE.md files for each major component
- Document all workflows with clear diagrams and descriptions
- Establish documentation standards and conventions
- Create agent interaction maps
- **MANDATORY: Update Learnings.md with project insights**
- **MANDATORY: Maintain ADR directory with all architectural decisions**

### Step 3: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
Think carefully about documenting:
- Every significant architectural decision in numbered ADR files
- Context and problem statement for each decision
- Considered alternatives and trade-offs
- Final decision with justification
- Consequences and future implications
- Follow ADR template: `docs/adr/NNNN-title-with-dashes.md`

### Step 4: Agent Ecosystem Setup
Using @agent-team-configurator, I will:
- Audit existing agents for completeness and relevance
- Identify gaps in agent capabilities
- Configure optimal agent collaboration patterns
- Define clear boundaries and responsibilities
- Set up communication protocols between agents
- **Document agent decisions in ADRs**

### Step 5: Agent Creation & Optimization
Using @agent-improvement-specialist, I will:
- Create missing agents in .claude/agents/ directory
- Update outdated agent instructions
- Align all agents with project goals
- Implement best practices for each agent type
- Ensure consistency across all agent configurations
- **Record learnings from agent optimization in Learnings.md**

### Step 6: Workflow Documentation
Be thorough in documenting:
- Development workflows with step-by-step guides
- CI/CD pipelines and deployment processes
- Testing strategies and quality gates
- Code review and collaboration practices
- Emergency procedures and rollback strategies
- **Capture workflow improvements in Learnings.md**

### Step 7: Continuous Learning Documentation
**CRITICAL - Update Learnings.md with:**
- Technical discoveries and solutions
- Performance optimization findings
- Debugging insights and resolutions
- Team collaboration improvements
- Tool and library evaluations
- Failed approaches and why they didn't work
- Success patterns to replicate

### Step 8: Final Validation
Take your time to verify:
- All documentation is accurate and up-to-date
- Agent ecosystem is fully functional
- Workflows are clearly defined and executable
- **Learnings.md contains all project insights**
- **ADRs document all architectural decisions**
- New team members can onboard easily
- Documentation serves as single source of truth

## Expected Deliverables
1. **Main CLAUDE.md**: Complete project overview and navigation hub
2. **Folder-specific CLAUDE.md**: Detailed documentation for each component
3. **Agent Registry**: Complete list of agents with their purposes
4. **Workflow Diagrams**: Visual representations of key processes
5. **Learnings.md**: Comprehensive project learnings and insights
6. **ADR Directory**: All architectural decisions properly documented
7. **Quick Start Guide**: For new team members
8. **Best Practices Guide**: Coding standards and conventions

## Non-Negotiable Requirements
- ✅ **Learnings.md MUST be updated** with every significant discovery
- ✅ **ADRs MUST be created** for every architectural decision
- ✅ **Documentation MUST be kept current** - no stale information
- ✅ **All changes MUST be traceable** through proper documentation

I'll now initialize your project documentation system. This will create a comprehensive, well-structured documentation that serves as the foundation for your project's knowledge base.

Think step by step through each phase, ensuring nothing is overlooked and everything aligns with your project's specific needs.

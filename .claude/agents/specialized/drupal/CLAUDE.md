# Agent Orchestration & Team Configuration

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Principle
**Think carefully and only action the specific task given with the most concise and elegant solution that changes as little code as possible.**

## ðŸ§  Agent Model Assignment Strategy

### Lead/Planning Agents (OPUS MODEL) ðŸŽ­
Strategic thinking, architecture, test conception, and complex problem breakdown.

### Execution Agents (SONNET MODEL) âš¡
Efficient implementation of well-defined tasks from lead agents.

## ðŸ”„ MANDATORY WORKFLOW PATTERN

### Every Task MUST Follow This Pattern:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Requirement] -->|OPUS Agent| B[Planning & Design]
    B -->|Detailed Specs| C[Task Breakdown]
    C -->|SONNET Agents| D[Implementation]
    D -->|Quality Gates| E[Testing]
    E -->|Validation| F[Deployment]
    
    B -.->|Test Scenarios| G[QA Planning]
    G -.->|Test Implementation| E
```

### Example Workflow Execution:

```bash
# 1. PLANNING PHASE (OPUS)
- drupal-technical-pm: "Break down this feature into tasks"
- drupal-solution-architect: "Design the technical architecture"
- Output: Detailed specs, test scenarios, acceptance criteria

# 2. EXECUTION PHASE (SONNET)
- drupal-senior-backend-dev: "Implement module per specs"
- drupal-frontend-theming-specialist: "Create templates per design"
- storybook-sdc-maintainer: "Build components per requirements"

# 3. QUALITY PHASE (SONNET)
- qa-testing-specialist: "Execute test plan and validate"
- security-auditor: "Run security validation"

# 4. DEPLOYMENT PHASE (SONNET)
- drupal-devops-engineer: "Deploy per deployment plan"
```

## ðŸš¨ QUALITY GATE ENFORCEMENT

### Automatic Quality Checks at Each Phase:

```yaml
pre_development_gate:
  required_lead_agents: [drupal-technical-pm, drupal-solution-architect]
  required_artifacts:
    - Requirements document
    - Technical specification
    - Test scenarios
    - Acceptance criteria
  snapshot: true

during_development_gate:
  tools:
    - ddev phpcs
    - ddev phpstan
    - ddev phpunit
    - ddev backstop test
  thresholds:
    code_coverage: 80
    phpstan_level: 8
    security_issues: 0

pre_merge_gate:
  all_tests: passing
  security_scan: clean
  performance: no_regression
  documentation: updated

pre_deployment_gate:
  staging_validation: complete
  rollback_plan: tested
  monitoring: configured
  approval: required
```

|-----------|------------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| New Feature | drupal-technical-pm, drupal-solution-architect | drupal-senior-backend-dev, drupal-frontend-theming-specialist | qa-testing-specialist |
| Bug Fix | drupal-technical-pm | drupal-senior-backend-dev | qa-testing-specialist |
| Component | drupal-ux-designer | storybook-sdc-maintainer, alpine-js-frontend-developer | qa-testing-specialist |

## ðŸŽ¯ CRITICAL RULES

1. **NO DIRECT EXECUTION WITHOUT PLANNING**: Execution agents cannot start without specs from lead agents
2. **MANDATORY QUALITY GATES**: Every phase must pass quality gates
3. **TEST-FIRST APPROACH**: Lead agents design tests, execution agents implement
4. **SNAPSHOT BEFORE MAJOR CHANGES**: Always create ddev snapshot
5. **CONTINUOUS VALIDATION**: Run quality tools continuously during development

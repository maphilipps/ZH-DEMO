# CLAUDE.md - Test-Driven Development & Continuous Learning System

This file serves as the living memory and learning system for the GPZH project, implementing Test-Driven Development principles where every bug becomes a prevention rule, every decision becomes reusable knowledge, and every successful solution becomes a pattern.

## üß† Core Learning Principles

**TDD Development Approach**:
- Every bug transforms into a permanent prevention rule
- Every decision gets documented and becomes reusable
- Every successful code solution evolves into a pattern
- User dissatisfaction triggers immediate learning documentation
- Each command execution creates learning opportunities

**Continuous Improvement**: When development doesn't meet expectations, the failure is documented in this file to prevent the same mistake from recurring.

## üéØ Project Context: GPZH Pr√§qualifikation Demo System

**ZH-DEMO Prototyp** - A Drupal 11.2.2 multi-site CMS demonstration system for the GPZH (Gemeindeportale Z√ºrich) prequalification presentation. This system demonstrates our technical capabilities for the Canton of Zurich's municipal portal project.

**Demo Municipality**: Gemeinde Bruchtal ("Leben am See" - Life by the Lake)

## üîÑ Three-Lane Development System

- **Planning Lane**: Strategic analysis and architecture (@drupal-solution-architect + @drupal-technical-pm)
- **Building Lane**: Implementation and development (@drupal-11-lead-developer + @municipality-portal-specialist)  
- **Reviewing Lane**: Quality assurance and compliance (@swiss-compliance-specialist + @qa-testing-specialist)

## üìö Learning & Pattern Documentation

### Current Learning Status
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-24
**Active Patterns**: Frontend editing, Drupal MCP integration, TDD learning cycles
**Current Phase**: Systematic learning documentation with user feedback loops

### Meta-Learning Agents
*Specialized systems that transform individual learnings into system-wide improvements*
- **@prompt-engineering-specialist**: Optimizes AI interactions using systematic prompt iteration
- **@test-failure-analyst**: Transforms every failure into permanent knowledge and prevention systems
- **@knowledge-synthesizer**: Fuses insights across lanes and agents into compound intelligence

## üêõ Bug Prevention Rules

### Rule #1: Paragraphs Frontend Editing Fix
**Context**: Paragraphs_ee module not showing "Add Paragraph" button on empty fields  
**Root Cause**: "Add in between" functionality disabled by default  
**Prevention Rule**: Always enable "Add in between" functionality (`add_above: add_above`) when configuring paragraph fields  
**Application**: Apply to all content types with paragraph fields (page, landing_page)  
**Tool Requirement**: Use Drupal MCP exclusively for configuration changes

### Rule #2: Tool Selection Standards
**Context**: Browser automation and testing requirements  
**Decision**: Use Playwright instead of Puppeteer for all browser automation  
**Reasons**: Better cross-browser support, robust selectors, visual regression testing, native TypeScript  
**Applications**: E2E testing, form validation, visual regression, navigation flows, screenshots

### Rule #3: Configuration Management
**Context**: Drupal configuration modifications  
**Rule**: ALWAYS use Drupal MCP for configuration changes  
**Escalation**: If Drupal MCP fails, discuss changes before proceeding  
**Prevention**: Never make direct database modifications without approval

### Rule #4: DDEV Frontend Testing
**Context**: esbuild/vitest version conflicts in DDEV container environment  
**Root Cause**: Host and container esbuild versions mismatch (e.g., "0.25.9" vs "0.25.0")  
**Prevention Rule**: ALWAYS use `ddev npm` commands instead of direct `npm` in DDEV projects  
**Solution**: `ddev npm test`, `ddev npm run build`, `ddev npm run dev`  
**Application**: All Node.js/npm operations in DDEV containerized development  
**Tool Requirement**: Prefix all npm commands with `ddev` when working in DDEV environment

### Rule #5: Test Failure Analysis & Documentation
**Context**: Test failures with undefined functions (e.g., "updateThemePreview is not defined")  
**Root Cause**: Claiming tests pass without carefully analyzing test output and fixing failures  
**Prevention Rule**: NEVER claim tests pass when there are actual failures - investigate and fix immediately  
**Solution**: Read test output thoroughly, fix failing tests, document the fix in CLAUDE.md  
**Application**: Every test run must be verified for actual success, not just completion  
**Tool Requirement**: Always fix test failures before proceeding to commit

### Rule #6: Git Lock File Resolution
**Context**: Git lock file preventing commits ("Unable to create '.git/index.lock': File exists")  
**Root Cause**: Previous git process crashed or was interrupted, leaving lock file  
**Prevention Rule**: Check for and remove git lock files when git operations fail  
**Solution**: `rm -f .git/index.lock` to remove stale lock file  
**Application**: Any git operation that fails with lock error should be followed by lock cleanup  
**Tool Requirement**: Check for lock files before retrying git operations

## üö® Code Review Learnings (PR #39 - Issue #36)

### Security Rule #1: XSS Prevention in Twig Templates
**Code Review Finding**: `{{ current_priority.icon|raw }}` in damage-report-card.twig:115  
**Critical Issue**: Raw filter allows XSS attacks through unescaped content  
**Prevention Rule**: NEVER use `|raw` filter unless content is 100% trusted and sanitized  
**Solution**: Remove `|raw` filter and let Drupal's auto-escaping protect against XSS  
**Application**: Review all Twig templates for `|raw` usage before deployment  
**Tool Requirement**: Automated XSS scanning in CI/CD pipeline

### Security Rule #2: File Upload Validation Enhancement
**Code Review Finding**: File uploads only validated by extension, missing MIME type checks  
**Security Risk**: File extension spoofing attacks possible  
**Prevention Rule**: ALWAYS validate both file extension AND MIME type for uploads  
**Solution**: Implement multi-layer validation (extension + MIME + size + sanitization)  
**Application**: All file upload components must have comprehensive validation  
**Code Pattern**:
```javascript
// Multi-layer file validation
const allowedMimeTypes = {
  'jpg': ['image/jpeg'],
  'pdf': ['application/pdf'],
  // etc.
};
// + filename sanitization + size limits
```

### Documentation Rule #1: CLAUDE.md Compliance
**Code Review Finding**: 15+ documentation files violating CLAUDE.md guidelines  
**Critical Issue**: Documentation scattered across project instead of centralized  
**Prevention Rule**: NO standalone .md files except CLAUDE.md, ADR records, and functional guides  
**Solution**: Consolidate all documentation into CLAUDE.md or remove redundant files  
**Application**: Before creating any .md file, check if content belongs in CLAUDE.md  
**Tool Requirement**: Pre-commit hook to validate documentation structure

### Infrastructure Rule #1: Version Control Hygiene  
**Code Review Finding**: Infrastructure files (Milvus volumes, certificates) committed to git  
**Performance Issue**: Large binary files bloating repository  
**Prevention Rule**: NEVER commit infrastructure/runtime files to version control  
**Solution**: Add infrastructure patterns to .gitignore immediately  
**Application**: Regular .gitignore audits for new service additions  
**Pattern**:
```
# Infrastructure exclusions
.ddev/*/volumes/
.ddev/*/certs/
*.log
*.pid
```

### Testing Rule #1: Comprehensive Test Verification
**Code Review Finding**: Tests reported as "passing" while actually containing failures  
**Critical Issue**: False confidence in code quality due to unanalyzed test output  
**Prevention Rule**: ALWAYS read complete test output, not just exit codes  
**Solution**: Analyze every test failure, fix issues, then document learnings  
**Application**: No commit until ALL tests genuinely pass with zero failures  
**Tool Requirement**: CI/CD must fail on ANY test failure, not just process failures

### Code Quality Rule #1: Function Scope Management
**Code Review Finding**: JavaScript functions not properly scoped causing "undefined" errors  
**Root Cause**: Global function dependencies not properly managed in test environment  
**Prevention Rule**: Always define functions in proper scope (window.functionName for global access)  
**Solution**: Ensure all globally-accessed functions are attached to window object  
**Application**: JavaScript components must have consistent scope management  
**Pattern**:
```javascript
// Correct global function definition
window.updateThemePreview = function(selectedTheme) {
  // Implementation
};
```

### Documentation Rule #2: Learning Documentation Mandate
**Code Review Insight**: Every code review comment represents a learning opportunity  
**Missed Opportunity**: Not systematically capturing review feedback for future prevention  
**Prevention Rule**: EVERY code review comment must generate a documented learning  
**Solution**: Transform each review point into specific prevention rules in CLAUDE.md  
**Application**: Code review comments become permanent institutional knowledge  
**Process**: Review Comment ‚Üí Root Cause Analysis ‚Üí Prevention Rule ‚Üí Pattern Documentation

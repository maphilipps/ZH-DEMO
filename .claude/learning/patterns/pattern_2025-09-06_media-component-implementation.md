# Implementation Pattern: Enhanced Media Component - Issue #94

**Date**: 2025-09-06  
**Pattern Type**: Component Development & Deployment  
**Complexity**: High  
**Impact**: Production-Ready Swiss Municipal Compliance

## Pattern Overview

Complete development lifecycle for a critical accessibility and performance component in Swiss municipal portal context, from architecture through production deployment with comprehensive automation.

## Context & Problem

**Challenge**: Legacy media component with 30/100 schema score, no accessibility compliance, poor performance metrics, and lacking Swiss municipal standards compliance.

**Requirements**:
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Swiss municipal portal standards (GPZH)
- Modern image formats (AVIF/WebP/JPEG)
- Performance targets (LCP < 2s, CLS < 0.1)
- Production deployment automation
- Zero-downtime migration capabilities

## Solution Architecture

### Phase-Based Development Approach

**Phase 1**: Foundation & Accessibility
- Schema enhancement (30/100 → 85+/100)
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance implementation
- Semantic HTML structure with figure/figcaption
- Multilingual alt text support (German/French)

**Phase 2**: Performance & Modern Features  
- Progressive image format enhancement
- Intersection Observer lazy loading
- Connection-aware optimization
- Core Web Vitals monitoring

**Phase 3**: Testing, Documentation & Deployment
- Comprehensive test suite (unit, accessibility, performance, E2E)
- Production deployment automation
- Migration scripts and rollback procedures
- Monitoring and analytics integration

### Technical Implementation Patterns

**Component Architecture**:
```yaml
# Drupal SDC structure optimized for accessibility and performance
components/media/
├── media.twig                    # Main semantic template
├── media.behavior.js            # Performance-optimized behaviors
├── media.css                    # Tailwind CSS with BEM methodology
├── media.component.yml          # Enhanced schema definition
├── templates/                   # Specialized media type templates
│   ├── image.twig              # Modern format support
│   ├── video.twig              # Transcript integration
│   ├── audio.twig              # Accessibility controls

    ├── README.md
    ├── MIGRATION_GUIDE.md
    └── PRODUCTION_READINESS.md
```

**Progressive Enhancement Pattern**:
```javascript
// Modern format selection with graceful fallback
const formatSupport = {
    avif: await supportsFormat('image/avif'),
    webp: await supportsFormat('image/webp'),
    jpeg: true // Always supported
};

const optimizedSrc = formatSupport.avif ? avifSrc :
                    formatSupport.webp ? webpSrc : 
                    jpegSrc;
```

## Reusable Patterns

### 1. Accessibility-First Component Development

```yaml
# Component schema pattern for accessibility
accessibility_properties:
  alt_text: {required: true}
  alt_text_de: {type: string}
  alt_text_fr: {type: string}  
  aria_label: {type: string}
  long_description: {type: text}
  
semantic_structure:
  - Use figure/figcaption for media content
  - Implement proper heading hierarchy
  - Ensure keyboard navigation support
  - Provide screen reader compatibility
```

### 2. Performance-Optimized Media Handling

```javascript
// Intersection Observer lazy loading pattern
const mediaObserver = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
    entries.forEach(entry => {
        if (entry.isIntersecting) {
            loadMedia(entry.target);
            mediaObserver.unobserve(entry.target);
        }
    });
}, { rootMargin: '100px' });

// Connection-aware quality adaptation
const connection = navigator.connection || navigator.mozConnection || navigator.webkitConnection;
const quality = connection && connection.effectiveType === '4g' ? 'high' : 'medium';
```

### 3. Swiss Municipal Compliance Pattern

```yaml
# Privacy classification system
privacy_levels:
  public: "Öffentlich zugänglich"
  internal: "Interne Verwendung"  
  restricted: "Eingeschränkter Zugang"
  
gdpr_compliance:
  external_content: boolean
  consent_required: boolean
  privacy_notice: text
  
multilingual_support:
  primary_language: "de"
  supported_languages: ["de", "fr"]
  fallback_behavior: "primary_language"
```

### 4. Production Deployment Automation

```bash
# Deployment validation pattern
validate_deployment() {
    check_environment_readiness
    run_comprehensive_tests
    validate_accessibility_compliance
    verify_performance_targets
    confirm_swiss_compliance
    create_deployment_backup
    execute_deployment
    validate_post_deployment
    setup_monitoring
    generate_report
}
```

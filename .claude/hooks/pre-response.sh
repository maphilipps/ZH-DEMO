🤖 **Compounding Engineering Learning Active - @agent Format**

User Feedback Detected: Specialized @agents will analyze this feedback for compound learning.

@agent Integration Points:
- @feedback-analyzer-agent: Process user feedback patterns and extract learning  
- @response-optimizer-agent: Adjust response approach based on feedback
- @learning-synthesizer: Update permanent knowledge base with insights
- @swiss-compliance-specialist: Ensure compliance context in responses
- @municipality-portal-specialist: Maintain municipal demo focus

Key Learning Areas via @agents:
- Lane coordination (@lane-coordination-specialist)
- Swiss Compliance (@swiss-compliance-specialist) 
- Municipal Forms (@municipal-forms-specialist)
- Process adherence (@process-optimization-specialist)

This feedback will compound into permanent system improvements via CLAUDE.md updates.

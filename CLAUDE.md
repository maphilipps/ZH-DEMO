## Compounding Engineering Framework

### The 5-Step Framework
1. **Teach Through Work** - Capture architectural decisions and patterns as they emerge
2. **Turn Failures into Upgrades** - Convert every bug into a test and prevention rule
3. **Parallel AI Orchestration** - Use multiple agents for planning, implementation, and review
4. **Lean Context** - Maintain focused, project-specific AI guidance
5. **Trust but Verify** - Enable AI autonomy with validation checkpoints

### Subagent Architecture
- **Executor/Evaluator Loop**: One agent implements, another reviews
- **Opponent Processors**: Two agents argue different perspectives for better decisions
- **Feedback Codifier**: Learns from code review comments and patterns automatically
- **Research Agent**: Explores similar projects and solutions in parallel
- **Log Investigator**: Specialized parsing of error logs and extracting insights

### Development Workflow Transformation
**From**: Developer writes code → Code review → Deploy
**To**: AI writes tests → AI iterates on implementation → AI refines based on failures → Human validates

### Test-Driven Development (Required)
- Every feature must start with tests
- Failed tests generate new rules to prevent similar issues
- Tests become smarter over time by learning from failures
- Systematic failure analysis creates compounding improvements

### Learning Loop Integration
- Every interaction becomes a lesson for future development
- Capture context in CLAUDE.md for AI agents
- Make implicit knowledge explicit and permanent
- Knowledge survives team changes and accumulates over time

### Quality Assurance Evolution
- Code reviews feed patterns back into development standards
- Performance and security practices evolve based on discovered patterns
- Higher pre-production bug detection rates through systematic analysis

## Enhanced ADR (Architecture Decision Records) System

The adessoCMS project implements an advanced ADR system with MADR 4.0.0 framework integration, Swiss municipal compliance automation, and multi-municipality scaling capabilities.

### ADR Workflow Integration

**Enhanced ADR Creation Process:**
1. **Automated Pattern Recognition**: System detects architectural decisions from code changes
2. **Municipal Context Synthesis**: Automatically identifies Swiss compliance requirements
3. **Stakeholder Identification**: Maps decision makers based on municipality governance patterns
4. **Collaborative Review Process**: Structured readout meetings with cross-functional teams
5. **Institutional Knowledge Preservation**: Captures decisions in compound learning system

### MADR 4.0.0 Framework Integration

**Modern ADR Templates:**
- **Decision Makers**: Clearly identified stakeholders with roles (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed)
- **Municipal Context**: Swiss government compliance requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA, CH-DSG, eCH-0059)
- **Multi-Municipality Impact**: Scaling considerations for Thalwil, Thalheim, Erlenbach
- **Compound Learning**: Integration with existing learning systems for continuous improvement

**ADR Infrastructure Commands:**
```bash
# Generate ADR with enhanced automation
node .claude/infrastructure/knowledge-synthesis.js

# Run predictive ADR analysis
node .claude/infrastructure/predictive-adr-engine.js

# Validate ADR automation infrastructure
node .claude/scripts/validate-automation-infrastructure.js

# Test enhanced ADR system integration

- **eCH-0059**: E-government standard compliance validation for service architecture decisions
- **Multilingual Support**: German, French, Italian, Romansh content strategy integration

**Compliance ADR Triggers:**
- Frontend component architecture changes → WCAG 2.1 AA compliance review
- Data processing workflows → CH-DSG privacy impact assessment  
- Service integration patterns → eCH-0059 e-government standard validation

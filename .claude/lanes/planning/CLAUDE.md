# Planning Lane - My Preferences & Patterns

**Lane Purpose**: Strategic analysis, requirements research, architectural decisions  
**Lead Agents**: @drupal-solution-architect + @drupal-technical-pm  
**My Style**: Thorough, documentation-heavy, Swiss-compliance-first

> See `llms.txt` for system-wide architectural decisions that never change.
> This file contains my personal preferences and patterns that evolve.

## ðŸŽ¯ My Planning Approach

### Primary Responsibilities
- **Requirements Analysis**: Deep dive into GPZH requirements, Swiss compliance, demo needs
- **Architectural Decisions**: System design, technology choices, integration strategies
- **Demo Planning**: 35-minute presentation structure, timing, scenarios
- **Strategic Coordination**: Cross-lane task planning and handoff orchestration

### When to Use This Lane
- New feature planning and architecture
- Requirements analysis for complex tasks
- Demo preparation and scenario planning
- Technical decision making
- Swiss compliance research
- Multi-site architecture planning

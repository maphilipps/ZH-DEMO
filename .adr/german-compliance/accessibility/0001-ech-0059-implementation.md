## Status
**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2025-01-20

**Authors**: @german-compliance-specialist, @qa-testing-specialist

**Reviewers**: @drupal-enterprise-architect, @drupal-frontend-theming-specialist

## Context

### Problem Statement
The GPZH project must comply with eCH-0059 German accessibility standards across all 160+ municipality websites while maintaining usability and performance requirements. This requires a comprehensive implementation strategy that goes beyond WCAG compliance.

### Business Requirements
- Full eCH-0059 compliance for all municipal websites
- Government accessibility audit readiness
- Inclusive design for all German residents and visitors
- Compliance verification and documentation system
- Municipal editor accessibility training and tools
- Long-term compliance maintenance across updates

### Technical Constraints
- Integration with Drupal 11 CMS and existing architecture
- Compatibility with Tailwind CSS v4 and component system
- Support for assistive technologies common in Switzerland
- Performance impact minimization (Core Web Vitals >90)
- Multi-language accessibility (German, French, Italian)

### German Compliance Requirements
- **eCH-0059 Standard**: German-specific accessibility requirements
- **Federal Act on Equality for Persons with Disabilities**: Legal compliance
- **Canton Zurich Guidelines**: Additional cantonal requirements
- **German Typography Standards**: Specific German design requirements
- **Government Integration**: Accessibility for e-government services

### Scale Considerations
- 160+ municipalities with varying technical capabilities
- Thousands of content editors with different accessibility knowledge
- Multiple content types requiring different accessibility approaches
- Scalable testing and validation system
- Automated compliance monitoring across all sites

## Decision

### What We Decided
We implement a **comprehensive eCH-0059 compliance strategy** that exceeds WCAG 2.1 AA requirements and addresses German-specific accessibility needs.

### Key Components
- **Base Compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA as foundation with eCH-0059 enhancements
- **German Extensions**: German-specific requirements beyond WCAG
- **Automated Testing**: Continuous compliance monitoring and validation
- **Editorial Tools**: Accessibility-first content creation workflows
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive compliance documentation and reporting
- **Training System**: Municipal editor accessibility education program

### Implementation Approach
- Establish eCH-0059 compliance patterns in base Drupal configuration
- Implement automated accessibility testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Create accessibility-first component library and style guide
- Develop municipal editor training program and tools
- Build compliance reporting and audit trail system

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: WCAG 2.1 AA Only
- **Pros**: Lower complexity, established standards, broader tool support
- **Cons**: Insufficient for German legal requirements, missing German-specific patterns
- **Why Rejected**: Does not meet eCH-0059 requirements and German legal obligations

### Option 2: Manual Accessibility Testing Only
- **Pros**: Complete human oversight, contextual evaluation, thorough assessment
- **Cons**: Unsustainable for 160+ sites, slow feedback cycles, inconsistent results
- **Why Rejected**: Cannot scale to 160+ municipalities with regular content updates

### Option 3: Third-Party Accessibility Service
- **Pros**: Expert knowledge, reduced internal overhead, comprehensive audits
- **Cons**: High ongoing costs, dependency risk, limited German-specific knowledge
- **Why Rejected**: Unsustainable costs for 160+ sites and limited eCH-0059 expertise

### Option 4: Minimal Compliance (Legal Minimum)
- **Pros**: Lower development costs, faster implementation, reduced complexity
- **Cons**: Poor user experience, audit failure risk, reputation damage
- **Why Rejected**: Inconsistent with project quality goals and German standards

## Consequences

### Positive Outcomes
- **Legal Compliance**: Full eCH-0059 and German legal requirement satisfaction
- **User Experience**: Inclusive design benefiting all users, not just those with disabilities
- **Risk Mitigation**: Automated testing preventing accessibility regressions
- **Competitive Advantage**: Exceeding accessibility standards for all municipalities
- **Long-term Sustainability**: Built-in compliance maintenance and monitoring

### Negative Outcomes
- **Development Overhead**: Additional development time and complexity
- **Performance Impact**: Minimal but measurable impact on page load times
- **Training Requirements**: Municipal editors require accessibility training
- **Maintenance Complexity**: Ongoing compliance monitoring and updates required

### Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: Accessibility regressions during content updates
  - **Impact**: High
  - **Probability**: Medium
  - **Mitigation**: Automated testing, editorial guidelines, and training programs

- **Risk**: Performance degradation from accessibility features
  - **Impact**: Medium
  - **Probability**: Low
  - **Mitigation**: Performance monitoring, optimization techniques, and testing

- **Risk**: Incomplete German-specific requirement coverage
  - **Impact**: High
  - **Probability**: Low
  - **Mitigation**: eCH-0059 expert consultation and comprehensive testing

## Implementation

### Requirements
- eCH-0059 standard documentation and expert consultation
- Automated accessibility testing tools (axe-core, Pa11y, etc.)
- Screen reader testing environment (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Performance monitoring with accessibility impact measurement
- Content editor training materials and documentation

### Dependencies
- Drupal 11 accessibility module ecosystem
- Tailwind CSS accessibility utilities implementation
- CI/CD pipeline integration for automated testing
- Municipal editor training program development

### Timeline
- **Phase 1** (3 weeks): eCH-0059 requirement analysis and gap assessment
- **Phase 2** (4 weeks): Base accessibility implementation and testing setup
- **Phase 3** (3 weeks): German-specific enhancements and compliance validation
- **Phase 4** (2 weeks): Training materials and documentation creation

### Success Criteria
- 100% eCH-0059 compliance across all municipalities
- Zero critical accessibility issues in automated testing
- Municipal editor accessibility training completion >95%
- Performance impact <2% degradation in Core Web Vitals
- German accessibility audit readiness and documentation

## German Municipality Considerations

### Scalability Impact
eCH-0059 compliance scales across 160+ municipalities through:
- Automated compliance testing preventing regressions across all sites
- Standardized accessibility patterns in shared component library
- Municipal editor training ensuring consistent accessibility practices
- Centralized compliance monitoring and reporting system

### Compliance Alignment
Exceeds German requirements through:
- Full eCH-0059 compliance with documented validation
- German typography and language accessibility standards
- Government integration accessibility patterns
- Cantonal requirement coverage for Zurich municipalities

### Multi-Language Support
Accessibility across German languages through:
- Screen reader compatibility with German German, French, Italian
- Proper language tagging and pronunciation support
- Cultural accessibility considerations for immigrant communities
- Consistent navigation and interaction patterns across languages

### Performance at Scale
Optimized accessibility implementation:
- Minimal performance impact through efficient implementation
- Lazy-loading accessibility features where appropriate
- Optimized screen reader markup reducing parse time
- Cached accessibility validation results

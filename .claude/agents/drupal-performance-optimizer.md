   - Implement shared caching strategies that optimize performance across municipal sites
   - Configure load balancing and horizontal scaling patterns for municipal portal traffic
   - Optimize content delivery networks (CDN) integration for Swiss geographic distribution
   - Create performance monitoring and optimization patterns that scale across multiple municipalities

**Working with GPZH Municipal Portal Requirements:**

- **Municipal Scale Optimization**: Optimize performance for realistic municipal content volumes (services, citizens, events, news)
- **Swiss Compliance Performance**: Ensure consistent achievement of 90% performance threshold across all municipal functionality
- **Citizen Experience Optimization**: Optimize performance for Swiss citizen device and connection patterns (mobile-first, rural connectivity)
- **Government Service Performance**: Ensure municipal service workflows and forms maintain optimal performance under citizen load
- **Demonstration Readiness**: Optimize portal performance for effective GPZH presentation and stakeholder demonstration

**Quality Assurance Process:**

1. **Performance Threshold Validation:**
   - Use automated performance auditing tools (Lighthouse, WebPageTest) with Swiss compliance thresholds
   - Test performance across all municipal portal functionality (services, forms, content, search)
   - Validate Core Web Vitals consistently meet Swiss government citizen experience standards
   - Monitor performance regression with automated testing and continuous integration
   - Ensure performance optimization maintains accessibility 95% threshold compliance

2. **Scalability & Load Testing:**
   - Load test municipal portal under realistic citizen traffic patterns and peak usage scenarios
   - Test multi-site performance scaling with Canton Zurich municipal expansion requirements
   - Validate database performance under large municipal content volumes and concurrent citizen access
   - Test caching effectiveness under varying content update patterns and citizen interaction workflows
   - Ensure performance optimization patterns maintain functionality and content accuracy

3. **Swiss Compliance Performance Monitoring:**

**Performance Optimization Pattern Library:**

```php
<?php

// Advanced Drupal caching configuration
$config['system.performance'] = [
  'cache' => [
    'page' => [
      'max_age' => 3600,
    ],
  ],
  'css' => [
    'preprocess' => TRUE,
    'gzip' => TRUE,
  ],
  'js' => [
    'preprocess' => TRUE,
    'gzip' => TRUE,
  ],
];

// Custom cache context for municipal sites
class MunicipalSiteCacheContext implements CacheContextInterface {
  public function getContext() {
    return 'municipal.' . $this->getCurrentMunicipalityId();
  }
  
  public function getCacheableMetadata() {
    return new CacheableMetadata();
  }
}
```

**Database Optimization Patterns:**

```sql
-- Municipal service index optimization
ALTER TABLE node__field_service_category 
ADD INDEX idx_municipal_service_category (field_service_category_target_id);

-- Citizen content query optimization
ALTER TABLE node_field_data 
ADD INDEX idx_municipal_published_content (status, type, created);
```

**Performance Monitoring Integration:**

```yaml
# Swiss compliance performance thresholds
performance_thresholds:
  lighthouse_performance: 90  # eCH-0059 minimum
  lighthouse_accessibility: 95  # Swiss government standard
  core_web_vitals:
    lcp: 2500ms  # Swiss citizen experience standard
    fid: 100ms   # Government interaction standard
    cls: 0.1     # Visual stability requirement
```

- **Performance Optimization**: Workflow efficiency optimization and bottleneck elimination

## GPZH-Specific MCP Integration

### Multi-Municipality Testing Orchestration
```bash
# Complete Multi-Site Validation Workflow
@mcp-orchestrate-testing GPZH-XXX --municipalities="thalwil,thalheim,erlenbach"
# Coordinates:
# 1. Playwright: Cross-municipality functionality testing

- **Compliance Validation**: Swiss compliance evidence collection and reporting
- **Audit Trail**: Complete workflow audit trail for regulatory compliance

## Advanced MCP Patterns

### Conditional Workflow Routing
```javascript
// Dynamic workflow routing based on task complexity
if (task.complexity === 'complex') {
  orchestrate([
    'sequential-thinking', // Strategic planning
    'atlassian-jira',     // Detailed breakdown
    'github',             // Architecture branch
    'memory'              // Pattern application
  ]);
} else if (task.type === 'multi-municipality') {
  orchestrate([
    'swiss-municipality-portal-specialist', // Coordination
    'playwright',         // Cross-site testing
    'browser-tools',      // Performance validation
    'memory'              // Result aggregation
  ]);
}
```

### Parallel Processing Coordination
```bash
# Simultaneous multi-municipality operations
@mcp-parallel-execute {
  "thalwil": ["playwright-test", "browser-audit", "puppeteer-demo"],
  "thalheim": ["playwright-test", "browser-audit", "puppeteer-demo"],
  "erlenbach": ["playwright-test", "browser-audit", "puppeteer-demo"]
}
# Aggregates results and coordinates next workflow steps
```

### Error Recovery Automation
```bash
# Automated error detection and recovery
@mcp-error-recovery-pipeline {
  "detection": "memory-search previous-similar-issues",
  "analysis": "sequential-thinking failure-analysis",
  "recovery": "github-revert + playwright-validation",
  "learning": "memory-store recovery-pattern"
}
```

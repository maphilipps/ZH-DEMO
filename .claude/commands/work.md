Think deeply about the user's request below and transform it into a structured, actionable development plan.

## Processing Protocol

1. **Extract Core Intent**: Analyze what the user REALLY wants to achieve
2. **Structure the Task**: Break down into concrete, executable steps
3. **Create Linear Issues**: Use @agent_linear-task-coordinator to:
    - Create main issue with clear acceptance criteria
    - Generate sub-issues for each component
    - Assign to feature branches
4. **Orchestrate Execution**: Use @agent-tech-lead-orchestrator to coordinate parallel work

## Execution Framework

Think step by step about:
- What needs to be built first (dependencies)
- What can be done in parallel
- How to integrate into existing codebase
- Where to use MCP tools for enhanced understanding

Be thorough in:
- Avoiding unnecessary files or documentation
- Keeping code production-ready and human-like
- Testing each component before integration
- Maintaining existing project structure

Take your time to:
- Consider edge cases and error handling
- Ensure seamless integration
- Review quality before completion
